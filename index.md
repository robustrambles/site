### Colin Bridge walks in Thanet and the South East of England

Colin Bridge is Local Footpaths Officer for the Ramblers' Association in Thanet. He walks, leads walks and writes walks in Kent and the adjoining counties of East and West Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Essex. 

The Robust Rambles range from short strolls and day walks to long distance trails from Kent into Sussex and beyond. The walks are free to download for personal use. 

The South East of England has a rich network of footpaths and a gracious countryside. However there are many hazards to walking and these robust walks demand mapreading, fitness, resourcefulness and sensible preparation. 

The rewards are splendid countryside, excellent views, charming and historic buildings and a sense of adventure.
