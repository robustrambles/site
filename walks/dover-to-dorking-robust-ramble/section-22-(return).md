  Comment: >
    An initial stretch of road walking but a pleasant country road, then a long return through mainly farmland. There is a lot of water evident on the map so be prepared for occasional wet and soggy fields in all but the driest weather. Many stiles; as ever keep a close eye on the map.

From the main road with the railway bridge behind and the Station Pub over on your right, go on, down the main road, for some way to a T-junction. Here turn left then immediately right, down Crab Hill Lane.

In a short distance, just before Crab Hill Farm entrance (before the road drops downhill), turn left on a pleasant woodland path. Keep on past a house, and over the M23 on a high footbridge. At the far side bear left on a clear path and follow it out to a road.

Cross the road and go forward on the entrance drive to Henhaw Farm. Keep on past buildings on both sides to a crossing of tracks. Turn right, downhill, and soon go over a stile on your right, and on, down, an enclosed path by paddocks and a pond to a stile.

Cross and go down to a second stile then bear left across the field to a hedge. Turn right and walk down a large field with a hedge and ditch on your left.

At the bottom corner, go left, over a stile and stream, then bear right to a further stile and footbridge. Cross the field ahead (possible wet) to a concrete footbridge over a wide stream. Keep ahead down the field with farm buildings in the distance.

At a corner in front of a pond, bear left to skirt the pond to a stile. Cross into a field and head across, just left of farm buildings, to a stile leading to a farm track. Go over the track to a rusty fieldgate.

Go through the gate onto a bridlepath going around the field edge with a hedge on your right. Pass the farm on your right and keep on through a fieldgate down to a track. Turn right on this and soon come to a crossing of ways.

Take the first path on the left over a stile by a fieldgate into a field. Go up the field by a hedge on your right to enter another field and then on more steeply, uphill to a stile. Keep on to another stile by a great oak tree.

Do not cross but turn left to follow along with a hedge on your right. At the next corner, drop down through a wide gap into an open field. Go diagonally left across the field to a stile hidden in the hedge, then on downhill in the same direction. Reach a further stile and go on again to a stile by a road. Cross and turn right up the road.

Walk uphill with care. Pass a wood on the right. Where the wood ends, by a wooden fieldgate, cross the road and go left into a field. Continue along by a wire fence to the far end of the field and then go left, still along by the fence and trees. At the bottom of the slope reach a gap on your right and cross a footbridge.

Go upto and into a large field. Head straight across the field, between two isolated trees, to a wood at the far side. Look for a waymark post showing the way into the wood. Enter and go down to a footbridge and on up to a stile into a field.

Cross the field bearing diagonally left and heading to the left of farm buildings, to the far opposite corner. Skirt some chicken coops to a stile in the far hedge behind. Cross to a further stile.

Go forward, ignoring two bridlepaths going off on your left. By a lone tree turn right into a muddy enclosed path. This soon reaches a concrete farm track. Turn left onto this track for some way, ignore side tracks and keep along to pass South Park Farm on your left. Stay on this roadway until it turns sharply right. Here turn left over a white stile into a field.

Go diagonally left down the field to a gap in the hedge on your left, with a stile and fieldgate. Cross the stile and go ahead along a fence with huge posts to a high stile in a wooden wall.

Go forward bearing slightly right down the field to a broken stile by a rusty fieldgate (very wet area) across a stream. Cross and go diagonally right, up the field, to a stile in a treeline. Go along the edge of the next field with a fence and treeline on your right to a stile. Cross and go on for some way with a hedge and ponds on your left.

At the very end of this field, in a corner, cross a stile and turn immediately right to another stile. Follow the hedge on your right downhill to a corner by a stream. Turn left to go along with the stream on your right.

The path keeps close to the stream but is very overgrown. Keep along as close to the stream as possible, to reach a stile by a road.

Cross the road with care to a kissing gate into a field. Keep on in the same direction to a stile at the far side onto the main A22 road. Turn left on the pavement and walk back into South Godstone under the railway bridge to the start of the section.
