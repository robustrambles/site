With ‘The Three Horseshoes’ behind, bear right across the road towards a telephone box. Just past this is a gap in the hedge leading to a footpath. Walk away from the road, straight across the field with a hedge and trees a little way over on your right. At the far side the path emerges onto an asphalt drive. Bear left on this and continue for ½ mile (ignore a footpath off right halfway along).

Finally, 20 metres before the gates of Bures Manor, turn left on a broad gravel track between lines of trees. Soon reach a stile by a metal fieldgate. Cross the stile onto a concrete track. Follow this for some way. At a bend ignore a bridle path on the left and continue, bearing right, on the concrete track. This soon changes to a gravel surface. Keep forward looking out for a junction of ways by fieldgates on your left and an ancient oak tree on the right. Beyond the gates bear left onto a narrow grassy path, quite narrow even though a bridle path.

This soon widens into a broad, grassy treelined avenue. Stay on this pleasant track for some way. Eventually reach the far end of the woods and pass through a metal gate into a field. Keep on with a hedge on your right to a gateway (ignore a path on your left).

Through the gateway bear right on a wide and rutted way between hedges. Soon reach the corner of a field on your left. Bear right on a farm track between a wire fence and a hedge on your right for a short distance. Just past an oak tree on your right, turn right over a footbridge and stile into a field. There are two paths here. Turn left, down the field edge, with a hedge on your left.

Just before reaching the bottom corner of the field, go left over a footbridge and stile. Turn right to go down to a long footbridge over a broad stream. Go forward into a field. Bear left across the middle of the field to a stile at the far corner.

Cross into an enclosed path in a wood with a fence on the left. At the end emerge into Leigh churchyard. Go ahead passing the church on your right, to exit through a wooden gate onto the village green. Go forward to a T-junction of roads with ‘The Plough’ pub on the right. Pass ‘The Plough’ and turn right on the busy Tapner’s Road. Walk along (there is a pavement) for nearly ½ mile to reach ‘The Seven Stars’ at Dawes Green and the end of the section.
