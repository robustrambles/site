With ‘The Dolphin’ on your left, go on down the road (there is a parallel path up by the wall on your right). Follow this down to a sharp left turn over Betchworth Bridge. Cross with care as it is very narrow. Immediately over the bridge turn right off the road through a metal kissing gate and walk away from the road on a clear path along the field edge to a wood.

Follow the path into the wood, down then up to a further kissing gate into a field. Turn right in the field to follow the hedge on your right for a few metres. At a corner of the hedge turn left away from it, diagonally across the field to stile at the far side onto a road. Do not cross but continue down the field edge with a hedge and road beyond on your left. Pass a cottage over on your left and reach another stile. Cross this onto the road. Turn right on the road.

Ignore a footpath soon reached on your left and continue downhill on the road. On reaching a second footpath on the left, cross a footbridge and stile into a meadow. Turn right downhill with a row of trees on your right to a footbridge, then on, uphill in the same direction. Ignore paths going off to the right and left. At the top pass a house and emerge onto a road by Gadbrook House.

Turn right on the road for some way passing detached houses. Finally reach a drive on your left between poplar trees to Hall Farm. Turn left in here and immediately left over a stile into a field. Bear right on a path down the field towards a tall hedge surrounding the farm. Keep on down by the hedge to a footbridge, then forward along the edge of a field with a hedge on your right.

Pass through a gap into a further field. Do not follow the hedge which drops away to the right. Instead bear diagonally left across the centre of the field to a footbridge and stile by a gateway at the far side. In the next field, go up with a line of trees on your left, to a stile onto a road. Turn left along the road to reach ‘The Seven Stars’ and the start of the section.
