From ‘The Wheatsheaf’, cross the road in front (with care as cars hurtle along) to the railway bridge and cross the railway. At the far side go straight on up the road ahead, ignoring the B2027 going off left. Keep on along the road soon uphill for ¼ mile. Look for a footpath going off left.

Cross into a field and walk away from the road on a grassy track with a ditch on your left. In 100 metres, by a power line pole, turn left over a plank bridge. Turn immediately right along the field edge with the ditch now on your right.

Where the ditch ends, keep on across an open space to the corner of woods. At the corner, go on with the wood on your left, for some way, crossing a footbridge along the way then reaching a stile. Over this continue on a pleasant footpath going down through woodland to a footbridge. Cross and bear right up to the edge of the wood.

Cross a low wire fence replacing a broken stile into a field. Turn immediately left and follow the hedge on your left for some way to reach a stile in the hedge at the end of the field. Cross onto a tarmac roadway.

Turn right on this roadway. Where it turns sharp right go forward through a gap by a metal fieldgate and up a slope to a stile in the corner of a hedge. Cross into a field. Walk up the field with the hedge on your left. Halfway up the hill cross a stile in the corner and keep on in the same direction up the next field to the top.

Here turn left. Pass a metal fieldgate on your left and continue up a grassy slope with a fence and treeline on your right. Go up into a field and keep on along the edge still with hedge and trees on your right. At the far corner of the field, go through a gap on your right and down rough steps to a road.

Turn left on this road, and soon reach a road junction. Turn right and walk past Roodlands Farm. Keep on for some way. Where the road turns left, cross a stile by a fieldgate, into a field. Bear right on a gravel track over the end of a stream. The path here turns diagonally left across the field to a gate and stile in the top opposite corner (if the path is not evident go around the field edge to the same place).

Pass into another field and keep on with the hedge on your right. Ignore a gateway in the hedge and head on towards trees. Having passed a pond in the trees on your left, bear left diagonally down and across the centre of a field towards a fieldgate in the far bottom corner.

In the corner turn left over a footbridge. Go on up the field ahead to a stile by a fieldgate leading to a road. Cross onto the road by the ‘Four Elms Inn’.

Cross the road to a path opposite and keep on through trees then on in the same direction passing two fields on your left. Emerge onto a road. Ignore a footpath opposite and turn right on the road. Ignore a second path going off left by two cottages. Continue to pass the buildings of Little Postling Farm.

Just past the farm turn left off the road over a stile by a fieldgate. Go down the edge of the field with a hedge on your left and power cables overhead. Cross a broken stile by a fieldgate and keep on down to a further stile in the bottom corner.

Cross and go through a patch of rough ground. Keep on in the same direction. Reach a junction of fields (currently some electric fencing here). Just keep on down the field under the power lines with the hedge still on your left. At the very bottom corner reach a footbridge.

Cross and go on up a field with a hedge on your right to a gateway. Through this gateway, go on up, with a hedge on your left and old farm buildings over on your right. Go through a metal fieldgate then a stile onto a track by a railway crossing. Turn right, away from the railway, and pass the farm buildings.

Pass detached houses. Where the track reaches a bay hedge with a secluded white house behind, turn left to a stile by an iron gate. Cross and go over to a squeeze stile. Bear right up a large pasture to another squeeze stile in the fence ahead. Through this continue in same direction by a treeline on your right to a stile in the top corner.

Keep on heading towards a lone tree at the far end of an embankment on your right. Keep on past the tree to a stile in the far corner. Cross into a wood and go on past a pond on the left to emerge into the open by playing fields. Keep forward on a rough track past pitches on the left then a pavilion to reach a swing gate by a metal fieldgate.

Pass into a car park. Turn immediately left and follow the hedge on your left past a house. Cross the entrance drive to the house and turn immediately left down an enclosed path to emerge onto a football pitch. Keep on down the edge of the pitch to a stile below a railway line.

Cross and climb up to cross the railway lines and reach a field at the far side. Go straight down the field away from the railway. Go through a gap and on in the same direction to a footbridge and kissing gate leading to a roadway.

Cross to a kissing gate and go forward with a fence on your right. Pass a pond on your right and continue through trees bearing slightly left into a field.

Go up the field edge with a hedge on your right (ignore a path going diagonally left up the field). At a gap, continue on, aiming for white railway cottages just visible on the hilltop. At the top corner bear right though a thicket to a wooden kissing gate at the righthand end of the cottage terrace.

Go through and turn immediately left along an enclosed path to emerge by a railway bridge. Turn right over the bridge and down a rough track to a public road in housing. Turn right a few paces then left down a close called ‘Churchfield’. At the end turn left down an enclosed path by a hedge.

Follow the path around to the right and go along to an iron kissing gate at the end. Go through and turn immediately right along the top edge of a churchyard. Stay on the path as it passes Edenbridge Parish Church on your left. At the end go through a lychgate and turn right along a road with a brick pavement to a T-junction in the middle of Edenbridge.

The ‘King & Queen’ pub is on the left at the end of the section.
