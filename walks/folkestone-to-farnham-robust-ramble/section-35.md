FOLKESTONE TO FARNHAM ROBUST RAMBLE

Section 35  Out

Rogate to Sheet

Map: OS Explorer 133 Haslemere  & Petersfield

Distance/Time: 5.5 miles/2.5m hours

Start: The White Horse pub in Rogate

Comments:  A walk in mostly open country parallel to the River Rother. The outward and return routes use opposite sides of the river valley. Inevitably there may be boggy patches. The A272 is never far away but to be crossed rather than much walked upon. The pub in Sheet is currently open every day,

With the White Horse pub on your right, and the Rogate Parish Church on your left, walk west, back along the main road (A272). Cross a side road, and go on, to pass the village shop on your right.

Soon reach the edge of the village. Where buildings on your right finish, reach a lay-by on your right, and a field entrance, just before it.

Turn right into the field (the footpath actually goes off right, halfway down the lay-by, up a bank, and through the hedge at the top). In the field, bear diagonally left, uphill, across the field, to a group of trees at the top.

On reaching the top hedge, go through a gap in the hedge, and down a bank, to a narrow road. Turn right on this, uphill, for some way.

On reaching a T-junction with another road, turn left, for a few paces, then right, up another country road.

In about 100 metres, just before a house entrance, by a telegraph pole, turn left, up a bank, into a field.

Go forward along the field edge, with a banked-up hedge on your right. At the end, go on, into a second field, and keep on, to a gap in the far corner, onto a farm road.

Go straight over to enter a further field, and keep straight on, a little uphill, then down, to a stile onto a sunken bridleway.

Turn left for a short distance, then turn right, on a footpath into a field. Go forward, to pass an isolated house called Carol’s Cottage on your right.

Keep on, to meet a bridleway between hedges (the Sussex Border Path). Turn right on this, a few paces, then turn left, into a field, with a line of trees on your left.

Follow the trees to a corner. Turn right, up to a second corner, then left, to continue, still following the hedge on your left, to the far end of a large field.

Leave the field and enter a wood. Ignore a path going right, and keep forward, uphill, on a very pleasant woodland track.

At the top of the wood, emerge into a grassy area, at the foot of a garden. Keep forward to a field entrance.

Turn left, into the field, then bear right, across to a hedge (great pile of grass cuttings in the way).

At the hedge, turn right, and follow down the edge of the field, with the hedge on your left (ignore gaps through to the next-door field).

Keep on for some way, down this huge field, to the very bottom. Turn left, through a gap in the hedge, to the next field.

Immediately, turn right, uphill, with an overgrown track between hedges on your right (this track is the right-of-way but currently impassable).

At the top of the field, turn right, with a line of trees on the left. Follow the trees to the left, around a corner, and keep on, to another corner ahead.

Here, go straight ahead, through the treeline, into a huge sloping field (laid to grass and cut like a lawn, possibly turf). Drop down, to pass a clump of holly trees. Keep on to a stile in the hedge at the far side.

Continue forward, with a fence on your left, to emerge onto the A272 main road. Cross with great care and turn left along the verge.

Soon, at a patch of grass, turn sharp right, up a woodland track. At a Y-fork, go right on a bridleway.

Soon drop downhill in a sunken track, for a good distance. Near the bottom, bear right, still on the bridleway, with a hedge on your left. Shortly emerge onto a busy road.

Cross and turn left. Soon go right, up a side road. Ignore another turning immediately right (Mill Lane), and go on up the Village Street, to reach the ‘Queen’s Head’ pub in Sheet and the end of the section.

Section 35  Return

Sheet to Rogate

Map: OS Explorer 133 Haslemere  & Petersfield

Distance/Time: 5.5 miles/2.5m hours

Start: The Queen’s Head in Sheet

Comments: The return touches the river itself and also finds memories of the old railway line between Petersfield and Midhurst. Lots of fields and footbridges. Some very boggy pastures, sticks or poles required and wellingtons recommended in all but the driest weather.

With the Queen’s Head pub on your left, and a little triangle of grass and trees on your right, go a few paces, up to a road junction.

Turn sharp left, down past the pub garden, on your left, and keep bearing left, down Inman’s Lane. Eventually reach a main road at the bottom.

Cross and go forward on the road opposite, gently downhill for ½ mile.

At the bottom the road crosses a stream, with metal pole handrails both sides. Just over this, turn left, by a metal fieldgate, onto a track into trees.

In 100 metres, bear left at a junction, over a footbridge, by a small pumping station, onto a narrow gravel path.

Keep through trees by a stream on your right. Soon go up the edge of a grassy open area.

Bear right at the top, over a footbridge, and keep along, with a river on your left. Ignore a turning off right. Keep on for 50 metres, until, by a dead tree on your left, bear right, ignoring a grassy path on your left, onto a gravel path, going up through trees.

Emerge onto a rugby pitch. Go forward along the edge, passing a pavilion on your left, then a car park. Continue in the same direction, down the entrance drive, passing offices on your left, and a leisure centre on the right.

Pass a flint cottage on the left and keep forward as the drive becomes a road. Pass a recreation ground on your right, then a wood on the left.

At the end of the wood, turn left on a minor road (pass unusual, circular storage units on your left). Where the road swings right, go forward on a rougher track, to a metal fieldgate.

Go through a metal kissing gate into a field. Go across the centre of the field (not downhill), bearing away from a fence on your right, to reach a line of bushes.

Keep forward, with the bushes on your right. At the end of the field, drop down, through trees, to a long footbridge over the River Rother, into a marshy field. Bear left, around to a stile at the far side, with a lone tree beyond.

Cross the stile and turn right, along the side of a field, for some way.

At the end of a rough patch, reach a junction of ways, with a stile on your right. Cross the stile into a marshy pasture, with a stream on your right. Keep across to a long footbridge. Cross this into a field at the far side.

Turn left, along the field edge, with the river on your left.

In 50 metres, reach a junction of paths, with a stile ahead. Do not cross, but turn right, uphill towards a house, between fields.

At the very corner of the house garden, turn immediately left, straight downhill, across the field, to a copse at the bottom. Turn right, along with trees on your left.

At the end of the trees, turn left, through a gateway, and cross a further field, to a stile.

Cross into a pasture, and keep forward. In the middle cross a long stile, and continue to a stile by a metal fieldgate, at the far side. Emerge onto a road.

Cross, and go on, up the drive to Down Park Farm. Ignore a footpath on your left. Further on, ignore the Sussex Border Path coming in from the right and soon going off left.

Stay on the drive, past farm buildings on your right, to meet a wooden fieldgate and a hedge ahead.

Turn right and continue to follow the drive. Where this soon turns sharp left, go straight on, on a rougher farm track, gently downhill.

At the bottom, where this track swings left, go straight on under power lines, through a metal kissing gate by a metal fieldgate, into a field.

Cross the field to a tractor bridge at the far side. Cross the bridge and turn sharp left, along the field edge by a hedge (ignore a footpath bearing off right across the field).

Keep along the field edge to a stile and footbridge, then on, by trees and bushes on your left. Go on for a good way, to the far end of the field.

At the corner, bear left, through bushes, to a stile and footbridge, then a further stile.

Over this, immediately turn left, over to a hedge of trees and bushes. On reaching this, bear right along the field edge, with the trees and bushes on your left.

Where these end, go forward on a path between fences. This drops down to cross a stream, then up through trees, to the corner of a large garden, below a new house.

Turn left here, to follow a fence on your left, then right, up a gravel track, to pass down the side of the house, and out onto a road in Nyewood.

Turn left along the road for over ½ mile. Cross under power lines, then on, uphill. Near the top pass sand banks on your right. Over the brow, drop down, past a letter box by an old sand pit.

Turn left on a concrete drive, just before the entrance to Sandhills Farm.

The concrete drive soon turns left. Bear right off it, towards outbuildings, for a few paces, then left, down an enclosed concrete path, with a hedge on your left. At the bottom enter a field, and keep straight on downhill.

At the foot, cross onto a country lane. Turn left downhill. Near the bottom, turn right, over a long footbridge crossing the River Rother.

Bear left, along the side of the river, for a short distance. Then, keep forward, uphill, into a very marshy pasture. Head over to the start of a line of bushes which go uphill.

The path crosses a footbridge and goes up, with the line of bushes on your right (IT IS VERY BOGGY AND DANGEROUS – TRY GOING UP THE RIGHT OF THE BUSHES).

At the top corner of the field is a stile. Cross and continue up, towards a wood. Keep forward with the wood on your right, to the top corner of the field. Go straight forward, still uphill, to a stile in the hedge ahead.

Cross and bear right, downhill, towards distant Rogate village. Follow the path down to the bottom, then bear right, by houses on your left. Opposite a road-end, turn left, across to a stile.

The stile leads into the road. Go up the road, to soon reach a junction. Turn right, uphill a short distance, then turn left, on a footpath in a corner of houses.

Keep on past a school, then on down a vehicle access road, to a main road. Turn right, to return to the White Horse in Rogate and the start of the section.
