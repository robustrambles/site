FOLKESTONE TO FARNHAM ROBUST RAMBLE

Section 38  Out

Selborne to East Worldham

Map: OS Explorer 133 Haslemere  & Petersfield

Distance/Time: 4.5 miles/2.5m hours

Start: The Selborne Arms in Selborne

Comments: Stiles, hills, huge fields and footbridges on a shortish walk. Lots of twists and turns so careful attention to detail.

(first walked 7/10/07 !)

With the Selborne Arms on your left, go forward, along the main road, passing the village shop on your left, The Queen’s pub on the right and the Gilbert White museum on your left.

Immediately after the museum, turn left, down a side road called Gracious Street. Keep on this for ¼ mile.

The road descends to a righthand bend (ignore a footpath off left). Follow the road between stone houses and cottages. Eventually reach a crossing of several paths and tracks, at the entrance to Grange Farm. Ignore all turnings and keep forward on the road, which begins to rise again.

Just past Hop Kiln Cottage on your right, turn right, onto a footpath on a farm track.

This soon reaches a stile by a metal fieldgate and enters a field. Go quite steeply up the hill, with the hedge on your left. Keep up over the hill to the very end of the field.

Go through a metal fieldgate and on, downhill, across a pasture, to a stile beneath a tree. Over the stile, turn right, down a steep bank, to cross a corner of a field, to a concrete bridge over a stream.

Turn immediately left, to follow the stream on your left, round to meet a hawthorn hedge.

Follow the field edge uphill, with the hedge on your left, for some way. Exit onto a main road via a metal fieldgate at the top.

Turn left for a short way, to reach a side road off left. Here, cross the main road, with care, to steps going up to a stile, into the field opposite (this path does not appear on the OS Explorer map).

Go ahead, away from the road, along the field edge, with a tall hedge on your right. At the corner soon reached, bear left, and follow the field edge, all the way along to the top corner.

Here, bear right, to a stile into the field ahead. Again, turn right, along the field edge, and bear left at the corner soon reached.

Keep on along the field edge, with a tall hedge on your right, for ¼ mile (it’s a big field !), to the far top corner.

In the corner, search in the undergrowth for a long footbridge (awaiting repair but usable). Cross and go forward to a stile.

Over this, bear right, up into a field (ignore a path going off across the field). Instead, turn immediately left, to follow the hedge on your left. Soon reach a stile into an enclosed path, on an embankment.

Keep along this, to emerge onto a gravel drive. Turn right on the drive for 25 metres, to a footpath going off left, over a stile into a field.

The path goes diagonally right, up the field, to a stile in the hedge at the top, just left of the top right corner (it may be necessary to zig-zag around an area giving cover to game birds).

Over the stile, keep forward, in the same direction, across the corner of another field, to emerge onto a road, through a barrier, by a large thatched house.

Turn left on the road for ¼ mile, passing houses and cottages. Eventually the road makes a sharp left turn, by a new house called Warners. Go straight ahead here, to cross a stile by a metal fieldgate, into a field.

Go forward across the field, bearing slightly right, to a double stile in a double wire fence.

Go on, gently downhill, to a further stile and footbridge at the bottom.

Cross and go on, up a field, to a gap in the hedge ahead. Here, cross a footbridge and keep on in the same direction, across another field, into a strip of woodland.

Go on up the field edge ahead, with trees on your left, to a corner. Here, bear diagonally right, away from the wood, across the field, towards grey barns and a water tank (there are cottages away over on your left).

On reaching a road, turn right and soon reach a bungalow. Turn left along an enclosed path, down the side of the bungalow, to a stile into a horse pasture.

Keep forward down the pasture, with a hedge on your left, to a stile at the far end. Cross and go down a steep flight of steps, to a main road.

Turn left along the road to the Three Horseshoes in East Worldham and the end of the section.

FOLKESTONE TO FARNHAM ROBUST RAMBLE

Section 38  Return

East Worldham to Selborne

Map: OS Explorer 133 Haslemere  & Petersfield

Distance/Time: 4.5 miles/2.5m hours

Start: The Three Horseshoes

Comments: Hills, stiles and footbridges. Some trees, for a change, on this return. A couple of sections of the Hangers Way. Some climbing to do.

With the Three Horseshoes on your right, return along the outward route. Go up the main road, past the bus stop, to the footpath going off right, up a steep flight of steps, to a stile at the top.

Cross into a long horse paddock. Go up, by the hedge on your right, to a stile at the top, into a narrow, enclosed path, along the side of a bungalow.

Emerge onto a road, do not turn right, but go straight across, to a green track, between a fence and a hedge on the right.

At the end of the field, go through a wide gap, into the next field. Immediately turn left, to follow the field edge and the tall hedge on your left. Follow round to the right, at the corner, and keep on, along by trees.

Keep along the whole side of the field, to a gap into the next field, and then on, under power lines, to a junction of footpaths. Drop down to the left on a clear path into woods.

At the bottom of the slope cross a stile, by a metal fieldgate, and turn right, along the edge of the field (pass the remains of an old hop garden). Soon reach a further gate, onto a farm track.

Go forward, past a rough triangle of land. Keep on the track, bearing right, up into trees. Soon reach a gateway and emerge onto a road.

Cross over and look for a long flight of steps, going steeply up the bank on your right. At the top emerge into a field. Turn left along the field edge.

At the corner ahead, turn right, by an amazing collection of water company signs (ignore a path leaving the field).

Keep along the edge of the field for a good distance, with the hedge on your left.

Pass a drop-down to a fieldgate onto a road junction, and instead, keep on along the field to the far end.

Here bear left, on the track down through trees, to a barrier giving on to a road, just short of the medieval church of Hartley Mauditt.

Turn left on the road, a short distance, to another metal barrier, into the field on your right. Enter the field and turn left, along the field edge, with a hedge on your left. Follow this up and around to the right.

At a corner, look for a footbridge in the hedge, into the next field. Cross and turn right, to follow the hedge on your right, up towards power lines and poles.

At the top of the rise, buildings can be seen ahead, at the far end of the field. Aim just left of them, crossing the field diagonally, and just right of a pole in midfield, to reach a corner of hedges, with a garden behind.

Keep going, diagonally left, to a dip in the ground, which becomes a farm track, leaving the field onto a crossing of roads and tracks.

Ignore paths to left and right. Go forward on a rough road, going uphill between hedges, towards a house.

At the top, pass several houses, and, ignoring a footpath off left, keep forward, through a gate, onto a narrow track going down through woods.

At the end of the path, go through a metal fieldgate, into a clearing. Keep on down, then turn left, still going downhill, with a fence on your left. At the bottom corner, reach a stile by woods.

DO NOT CROSS, but turn right, on a grassy path going diagonally down, across the field, to the far opposite corner. This is the Hangers Way.

At the far corner, pass into a wood on a broad, muddy track. Stay on this, downhill through the wood, to the far side and a stile. Cross and bear left, downhill, towards a lake.

Just before, turn right, over a stile by a metal fieldgate, and bear right, uphill, to a metal swing gate.

DO NOT GO THROUGH, but turn left, along the field edge, with fence and trees on your right.

At the end of the field, drop down to a kissing gate, into trees. Go forward to enter a valley. Stay on a clear path, by the hedge on your right.

This is National Trust land and the path is made up with gravel. After some way, go through a gate, pass a little valley on your right (ignore a footpath going up it), then go through another gate, and on in the same direction.

Eventually drop down to a footbridge. Over this the path splits. Bear right, steeply uphill, to enter the churchyard of Selborne Church. Keep forward, passing the church on your right.

Leave the churchyard at the far side, and cross a little green to a main road, by the Gilbert White Museum. Turn left along the road to return to the Selborne Arms and the start of the section.
