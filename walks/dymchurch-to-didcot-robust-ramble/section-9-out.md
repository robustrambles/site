From the Woodcock Inn car park, cross the road to an enclosed footpath going downhill, the Woodcock Inn is passed on the right. Go down to a gate into an orchard. Keep on up in the same direction with a fence and bushes on the right. Pass an old orchard on the left and eventually drop down to emerge over a stile by a metal fieldgate onto a road.

Turn left down the road for ¼ mile. Pass Little Standen and Standen Farm, then, by a post box, turn left off the road onto a gravel drive. Pass Standen Barn and keep on along the drive through a gateway and down past oasts. Go along by a garden on your left to a stile by a wooden fieldgate. Cross and continue along with a hedge on your right and an old orchard on the left.

On reaching a metal fieldgate on the right, turn right down to a stile into a field. Go forward down the edge of the field with a treeline on the right. Cross a stile into another field and keep on by trees on the right. Swing left at the corner and pass a pond down on the right.

Where trees end, go forward past a metal fieldgate and on by a fence to a stile. Cross and go on, away from the pond, downhill with a wire fence on the right.

At the bottom corner, cross a stile into a further pasture. Turn immediately left, downhill, by a fence and treeline on the left to a footbridge at the bottom. Cross and go up through trees, past an old safari wagon, to steps to a stile. Keep forward to a road at Cattsford.

Turn right on the road. At the next road junction bear right for ¼ mile to a further junction. Again bear right up Standen Street for ¼ mile. Pass a house on the right and in 100 metres turn left off the road to a stile by double wooden fieldgates.

Do not follow the hedge on the right but bear left on a broad green way between tree nurseries. At the far side turn right along by a wire fence on the left and an orchard beyond. Soon reach the corner of the orchard and fence. Turn left over a stile by a wooden barrier. Bear diagonally right down and across the centre of a large field. At the far side there is a pond in trees down on the left. Leave the field through a gap over a ditch passing the pond on the left to enter a field ahead. Go on across the next field in the same direction, down to an improvised gate out onto a road.

Turn right for 200 metres. Cross a brick bridge. Pass a rusty fieldgate on the right and immediately come to a second metal fieldgate. Turn right off the road through this into a hop garden. Go diagonally left uphill between the hop poles. Emerge near the top corner. Bear left to a huge pole right in the corner. Just left of this is a stile and footbridge in the hedge. Cross into another hop garden.

Turn right along the edge passing a pond on the right and drop down to a concrete road. Turn right for a few paces then turn left through an opening into another hop garden by a new wooden gate. Keep forward along the edge with bushes and a ditch on the left.

At the far corner go through a gate and turn left on a grassy path with a wire fence on the right and a steep bank on the left. Continue for some way and eventually go through a gate into a field. Bear left uphill to a windmill.

Go just right of the mill through a wooden kissing gate. Keep forward, diagonally left downhill to a stile with a white school building beyond. Cross into an area of scrub. At the far side exit into a school playing field and go on to a double gate into a car park.

Go forward to the main school entrance and turn left down to a main road in Sandhurst. Turn right up the road. Go to the top of the hill and on down past Sandown Tearooms to the New Swan pub and restaurant. This is the end of the section.
