With the ‘Nutley Arms’ on the right, walk back up the main road. Pass the village shop on the right and continue up to reach the parish church on the left. Turn left off the main road on the side road called Bell Lane just before the church. Keep along the road for nearly ½ mile.

Where the road turns left, bear right down the entrance to ‘Tinkers’. Go down a set of steps into a path enclosed by trees and bushes. This is an interesting and atmospheric path going up a narrow and rather boggy valley. At the top in front of a fence and a stand of beech trees, bear left to a stile over the fence. Turn right on a grassy track. Walk up to a metal fieldgate and cross a stile into the field on the left. Go ahead along the hedge on the right and on into and across the top of a second field.

Cross a stile by a corner of woodland and go forward to a second stile actually into the wood. Continue uphill on a narrow path, ignoring cross paths, to eventually pass under power lines and emerge onto an asphalt drive. Turn left down the drive.

On reaching a Y-fork, keep right. Pass cottages on the right and immediately turn right up a bank by a water tank to a stile. Cross to a grassy area and bear right around to a second stile leading into the top corner of a meadow. Go across to the bottom corner of a garden hedge. Go on with the hedge on the left, passing the end of a garden and on down the side of the meadow with hedge on the left.

At the bottom corner bear left over two stiles and a farm bridge to the foot of a rising field. Cross straight over to a stile in a corner of woodland. Enter the wood and go forward. Soon reach a junction of ways. Bear right, downhill, into a soggy valley (there are boardwalks). Continue up to a junction of paths by a lawn. Ignore the path off right and bear left across the lawn. Pass a house on the left and go forward on the entrance drive, uphill for a good distance (ignore a footpath off left). The drive becomes tarmac and eventually reaches a public road.

Turn right on this road, ignoring a side road going off left. Keep on for 100 passing metres Upperstone Farm. Continue on until just before houses start on the left turn left along a stony track to Stonehouse Farm. Wind down this to a set of gates. Go through and bear left then right to reach a fence. Go forward through a swing gate into a meadow and go forward with a hedge on the right. At a corner , turn right and follow the fence on the right then a brickwall to a stile in the top corner of the field. Cross onto a road and turn left down to the ‘Coach and Horses’ pub and the end of the section.
