With the William Caxton pub behind, cross using the traffic lights, to the other side of the main road by a restaurant. Turn left on the pavement out of the town towards Rolvenden and Hastings.

Keep on the main road downhill, ignoring a footpath going off right by a tall brick wall. Continue down to Cranbrook Road going off to the right. Turn right along this road for a few paces then turn left off the road through a rusty fieldgate into a large pasture.

Go diagonally right across the field past a lone tree, heading just right of farm buildings to a stile and footbridge at the far side. Cross and continue in the same diagonal right direction, passing the farm on the left, down to the far bottom corner. Cross a decrepit stile and walk a few paces to a rusty fieldgate leading to a railway crossing.

Cross the railway. At the far side go forward to a footbridge. Over this turn sharp left and walk along parallel with the railway on the left. At the end of the field cross a footbridge between two stiles in the hedge and head uphill through a gap in the next hedge, towards New Barn Farm at the top.

At the top of the field go through a metal fieldgate into the pasture in front of the farm. Go over towards the farm house and pass through another metal fieldgate and forward through the farm buildings.

Pass a white cottage on the right and go on through a wooden fieldgate into a large field. Keep forward along the hedge on the left. At the far end, go on, along a broad green way between trees. Pass a house on the left. The track soon becomes a concrete farm track. Keep on this for a quarter of a mile to reach the entrance to Halden Place.

Here turn right into the field on the right through wooden fieldgates still on a concrete track. Where the concrete ends, go on into a large sloping field. In the distance, at the top, is an oasthouse in trees. Head up the field aiming left of the trees which hide the oast. In the far corner is a decrepit stile out to a road.

Turn right along the road passing the oast on the right. Just after a sharp left bend, before another oast, turn left off the road, over a stile in the hedge, into a field. Bear right up the hedge on the right down to a stile by a pond. Continue down the next field with a hedge on the left.

Where the hedge ends, go on, bearing right, round an old pond in trees on the right, down to the righthand end of a wood at the bottom of the hill (currently there is a wooden waymark post here).

From the tip of the wood keep on in the same direction, diagonally across and down a pasture, away from trees on left towards the far opposite bottom corner in a deep valley.

On nearing the corner, look for a stile in the fence, just right of the corner. Cross the stile to a field and bear left across to a long metal footbridge in bushes leading to a pleasant grassy enclosed path going uphill for Â¼ mile.

Eventually enter a farm through a wooden fieldgate. Go forward to pass the farmhouse and then two oasts. Immediately go left over a stile by two wooden fieldgates and on up through orchards by a hedge of poplar trees on the right. At the end of the poplars, cross a stile by a gateway, into a field. Immediately bear left on a grass track around, down and across to a conifer wood beyond.

Pass the trees on the left and then go left through a rusty fieldgate to an old stile at the top end of a hedge. Cross and go diagonally right downhill between spaced out conifer trees. Funnel down the field to the very bottom far corner. Enter woods through a gap in the corner. Go down steps then out of the wood over a stile into a rough pasture.

Bear right uphill to a stile and rusty fieldgate at the top. Cross into a pasture. Go up by the hedge on the left to a stile near an oast. Cross and go forward to pass a pond on the right and oasts on the left to a T-junction.

Turn right on a concrete track up to a range of newish cowsheds (1998). Turn left on a farm track passing farm buildings and the farm house on the left. Where the concrete swings right, go straight on through a wooden fieldgate into a sloping field.

Bear slightly left downhill to the end of a wood with telegraph poles bearing away on the right. Ignore a metal fieldgate into the wood and keep on down the side of the wood on the left to the bottom corner. Go through a kissing gate and on down through woods.

Cross a footbridge in the ravine and go steeply up to a kissing gate into a field. Go on, up by trees on the left, to a kissing gate at the very top. Go forward across an irregular shaped pasture to a kissing gate by a wooden fieldgate and ponds.

Go forward on a pleasant enclosed path. Eventually emerge onto a road in Rolvenden by The Bull Inn. Turn left to the main road ahead.

Turn right on the main road to soon pass the village shop and reach The Star pub and the end of the section.
