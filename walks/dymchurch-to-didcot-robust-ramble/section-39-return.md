With the ‘Calleva Arms’ on your left and the common on your right, walk away from the road junction towards a children’s play area. Almost immediately turn left along a side road called Dukes Ride. Pass houses on your left. Where the road swings left, bear right onto a track upto a gate into trees. Keep on this path for ½ mile, ignoring side tracks.

Pass Upper Inhams Copse on your left, and descend on the path as it bears slightly left to a long plank bridge over a seasonal stream. Eventually reach a junction with a wide gravel bridleway.

Turn left on this down to a wide equestrian bridge. Cross and follow the bridleway for ¾ mile to a road. Halfway down ignore a cross path. Near the end of the path go through a gate and then cross a bridge to soon reach a road.

Cross bearing slightly right to a stile into woods. Follow a pleasant path. At the top of the woods ignore a path off left and keep forward with a field over on your right. At a Y-fork bear right through a squeeze stile and keep on in the same direction as before.

Eventually leave the woods over a footbridge into a corner of a new plantation with power lines overhead. The going over the next ¼ mile is a little rough. Go forward up the plantation in the same direction as before. At the top, by mounds of dumped earth, turn right to follow a hedge on your left.

Keep along past the plantation then on down a field to a hedge across the bottom. Here turn left for a short distance along to double wooden field gates and a stile and exit onto a road. Turn left on this road.

Soon reach a T-junction at Latchmere Green. Turn right. Just past a thatched cottage on your right, turn left off the road by a metal fieldgate and iron posts. Follow the path by a ditch and trees on your left for 50 metres.

Here stay on the path as it swings right to go between fields towards distant power lines. Keep on for some way. Ignore a farm track off right and continue to pass under the power lines. Immediately leave the gravel track and turn right to drop down a grassy slope into a corner of a field.

Turn left into a narrow enclosed path which follow the field edge all the way out to a road. Turn left on the road.

In 75 metres turn left off the road onto a gravel drive. Pass a house and cross the parking area at the rear to enter a narrow overgrown enclosed path up the edge of a field on your left. Eventually pass a church over on your right and reach a cross farm track.

Turn left on this then immediately right along a field edge with a hedge on your right. At the end of the field drop down onto a gravel drive and soon reach a road.

Cross and turn left. This road leads back to ‘The Bramley’ pub and the start of the section.
