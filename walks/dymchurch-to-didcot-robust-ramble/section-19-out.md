With the ‘Coach and Horses’ pub on the right, walk away from the main road down a side road past a post box. Keep on the road to a junction. Here turn right a short distance. Look for a car parking area on the left. Walk down this to a very narrow footpath enclosed between fences. At the bottom cross a footbridge and go up to a T-junction.

Turn left and go up through woods. Soon reach a Y-fork and bear right very steeply uphill. At the next junction turn right and continue uphill to emerge into the corner of a playing field. Keep uphill on a gravel track then go forward through school buildings. On reaching the end building which blocks the path, bear right around it to a kissing gate and emerge onto a road.

Turn left on the road a few paces then turn right over a stile by a metal fieldgate. Walk downhill following a hedge on the left. Keep by this all the way down and round to the bottom corner and a T-junction with a bridleway by a metal fieldgate. Turn right on this grassy bridleway, soon dropping down through a wood (rather muddy). At the bottom, just before a pond and bridge, turn left on a footpath into the trees.

Go forward to cross a footbridge and keep on up to meet a gravel drive. Turn left on this a few paces then right uphill by a treeline on the right. Keep up through trees to a wooden swing gate at the top. Go through into an enclosed path going up the edge of a field. On reaching a large shed, turn right into undergrowth and follow a Holly hedge on the right to soon emerge by cottages and emerge onto a road.

Turn right on the road for 100 metres, then left over a stile by a wooden fieldgate onto a concrete track. On reaching tall gates, turn right on a path through trees and eventually emerge into a field. Go forward a short distance looking for a gap in the hedge on the left. Go through a kissing gate and cross the centre of the field ahead bearing slightly diagonally right to a second kissing gate in bushes. Continue on in the same direction to a third kissing gate in the far opposite corner.

Go on along an obvious path with a hedge on the left. Reach yet another kissing gate and go down past allotments and the village hall to an entrance drive. Turn left to shortly emerge onto a road with the Horsted Keynes Village Stores on the right and ‘The Crown’ pub (currently closed, but The Green Man is just down on the right) opposite and the end of the section.
