  Comment: >
    A pleasant walk with just one rather boggy stream to cross. There are constant changes of direction and new vistas to see. The road walking section is very quiet. There are some excellent timber framed farmhouses to enjoy. There are many stiles.

From the car park of the Waterwitch pub, turn right uphill on the road on the same route as before. Just over the brow of the hill, opposite a red post box, turn left up an asphalt drive. This passes the side of a house and narrows down to an enclosed footpath. Follow this for some way, then through two metal kissing gates to reach a main road.

Cross to a third kissing gate, and go down the pasture to a fourth. Continue to a fifth in the hedge at the bottom. Here meet a cross track and turn left on an enclosed path with a fence on your right. This follows the field edge down to a ford. There is a boardwalk but the area is rather waterlogged.

At the far side go ahead across a field. There is a hedge on your right to start with but the path gradually veers away towards the end of a hedge ahead. On reaching an old stile at the end of the hedge do not go along by the hedge but keep straight on across the field to an old metal fieldgate. Cross a stile by this and turn right up the field with a hedge on your right.

Leave the field at the top corner into an enclosed path alongside a horse sand school. Soon reach and cross a footbridge on your right. Bear left diagonally across the centre of the field to a stile in the fence at the far side. Cross the drive and go down steps to a plank bridge into a wood. Turn right and walk down to a road.

Turn right a few paces, then left, up a gravel drive, then immediately turn right up a bank to a stile. Cross into a small field and bear diagonally left across to the far opposite corner. Cross a stile into a garden area and go along the top edge to a small wooden gate.

Go through and turn right up an enclosed path with a wooden fence on your left. At the top cross a stile into a large undulating field. Turn left up the field edge and continue for ¼ mile. At the top corner ignore a gap and turn along the top edge a short way to another corner. Go left up a bank, through a gap, to a corner of a field with a planting of young trees. Go straight up with a hedge on your right. Ignore a path off left through the trees.

Keep straight uphill up the field and on in the same direction for ½ mile to a road. Turn left along the road through the buildings of Roke Farm (ignore a side road going off left) for ¾ mile. Ignore a cross path into woods halfway along and eventually reach Park Farm. Just past the last building on the right (a converted oast), turn right up a rough drive. In a few paces bear left into a field and continue in the same direction along the field edge with a sketchy hedge on your right. At the top corner go through a wide gap over a ditch into the field ahead.

Here turn immediately left to go down the edge of the field with a hedge of trees and the ditch on your left. At the bottom of the hedge where the ditch ends, turn sharp right into the field. In 10 metres turn sharp left down the field towards farm buildings and pylons in the distance.

Pass under power lines and keep on now with a hedge on your left, down to a road. Turn right a few paces then left at a junction towards a house. In 50 metres turn left off the road onto a footpath going down a field edge with a ditch on your right. Follow this for ¼ mile. At the bottom corner cross a footbridge onto a road.

Turn left along the road a short distance to a junction with a side road. Go through a gap here into the corner of a field. Ignore a path going diagonally right up the field and go along the bottom of the field with the hedge and road on your left. At the end of the field, where the first houses of Crondall begin, drop left down onto the road.

Turn right along to return to The Plume of Feathers in the centre of the village and the start of the section.
