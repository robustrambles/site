From the Queen’s Head retrace your steps a short distance to Castle Street. Turn up here. Look out for an alleyway off left called Long Alley Walk, it is signposted on The Scholars Way. Soon pass the Hop Blossom pub and keep on to go up the side of a supermarket and left along the top side by a car park. Keep on along the road to pass the buildings of the University of Creative Arts.

Immediately past UCA, turn right up the access road. Where this road swings right, go straight on up a grassy way between trees and a mobile building. At a field edge bear left on a track across the field.

Near the top of the field, turn left, off the track, across the corner of the field to a junction at the far side. Turn right a few paces along the edge of the field to the top corner and another junction. Here go straight ahead out of the field through the hedge at the corner. Enter an enclosed path between hedge and fence and keep on up to the top. This section may be muddy.

At the top emerge through a wooden kissing gate into a grassy paddock. Bear left diagonally across to a gateway in the far opposite corner. Continue downhill on an enclosed path.

Follow an easy path down and over a footbridge and then on up through the wood to a metal fieldgate. Enter a field and bear right uphill by a fence on your right. Just past three trees, turn right through double metal fieldgates and cross the centre of the field.

At the far side exit through a metal fieldgate and go down to a wooden fieldgate and onto a drive at Middle Old Park. Turn left along the drive passing Keepers Cottage and go on to a house gateway. Here turn right off the drive through a wooden kissing gate. Go diagonally left across the field to a small gate into a wood (ignore a fieldgate further to the right).

Go down to a footbridge and up to emerge into a field. Cross very slightly right to a gap in the middle of a thin row of trees. As you cross a metal fieldgate appears in the gap. Exit onto a road and turn right.

In 100 metres turn left up the drive to Meadow Cottage, where the drive swings left go ahead through a metal kissing gate into a field corner. Bear left, uphill, by the fence on your left. At the top of the rise pass The Mount on your left, a newly planted open access woodland.

Go on downhill. Leave the field at the bottom corner and go on through new trees to a golf course. Go on down the edge and exit through a muddy bottom corner to a level field.

Turn sharp diagonally right across to the far opposite corner. Just short of the corner leave the field through a gap on the left and go up the edge of the field beyond with a hedge on your right. Exit onto a road.

Turn right for ¼ mile soon entering the village of Crondall. Turn right up the first turning on the right (Heath Lane). Just after the last house on the left, turn left onto a footpath by a stream. Continue along the bottom edge of a golf course. Exit via a metal kissing gate and go forward 100 metres to a further kissing gate and reach a road.

Turn left into the village, pass a shop on your right and soon reach The Plume of Feathers in the centre of Crondall and the end of the section.
