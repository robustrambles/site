With the Hurtwood Inn on your right, walk up the road. Almost immediately turn right off the road through a wooden kissing gate into an enclosed path going uphill. At the top pass an open grassy area on your right then buildings on your left. Reach a gravel drive. Turn right on this down to a road. Turn left on the road.

In 100 metres turn right on a bridleway. Pass a metal fieldgate and continue on an easy path. Eventually reach and pass through another pair of gates and go on downhill along a field edge. At the bottom pass through a final pair of gates and bear slightly right uphill on a narrow path by a wire fence on your right. Follow this out to a road.

Turn right on the road for 100 metres then left up a concrete drive by the entrance to Hound House. Keep on the concrete past a house on your right. The concrete gives way to grass. Pass houses on your left keep on uphill. On reaching a junction of ways where corners of fields meet, turn right downhill on a path between fences. Go through two old metal fieldgates then on down a grassy path to a tree. Here bear slightly left down towards more trees. Pass through these.

At the bottom, cross a stile into a field corner. Follow the fence on your right as it turns right. Follow it and the field edge down to the bottom. Here bear left to an old farm building. Exit through a swing gate to a drive. Turn left on this and go uphill through a gateway to meet a byway.

Turn right on this downhill a short way. Soon turn left over a stile into an enclosed path. The path meanders but is easy to follow. Eventually reach a junction of ways by a corner of a forest chalet site. Bear left to a wooden kissing gate and on to soon reach a drive. Go straight ahead to a concrete ramp on your left with rails. Go up to continue up an enclosed path.

At the top go right on a drive a few paces then left uphill. Join another drive and continue uphill. At the top follow round to the right then downhill, still on the drive.

Where the drive turns sharp right, go left across a parking bay and past a fire point. In a few paces turn left up by a laurel hedge to leave the caravan site by a wooden kissing gate into an enclosed path along a field edge. At the bottom, go through a further wooden kissing gate into a paddock.

Do not go down the edge but bear left across the centre aiming between two houses to a wooden kissing gate into a path enclosed between garden fences. Emerge onto a road and turn right. Pass a patch of common land on your left and a sandy track meeting the road. Just beyond bear left onto a track going up the side of the village green at Farley Green. Pass three trees on the right and the remains of the village pond then meet a road.

Turn left on the road for 100 metres. At a bend turn right off the road to face the start of two gravel tracks. Take the lower one on your right and walk along for nearly half a mile. Go gently downhill then up to reach a Y-fork by outbuildings. Bear left to pass Lipscombe Cottage and continue through trees.

By a house entrance the asphalt surface ends. Go straight ahead into woods (ignore a path off right). Reach and cross a sandy bridleway and continue through the woods ahead. Pass a house on your right and soon reach an unmade vehicle track. Turn left on this and follow it down to a T-junction by a chalet bungalow. Turn right here on a sandy track.

This soon turns left. Go straight ahead on a bridleway uphill in woods. Ignore side paths and keep on this broad sandy track for 150 metres. Near the top of the hill, where the path is eroded and sunken, there is a wooden post (no signs on it), turn left here on a wide sandy track but more level than the previous one.

At a Y-fork bear left. Follow this track for ½ mile passing a seat. Eventually emerge into the car park at Blackheath Common. Go down to a road. Cross straight over to another sandy bridleway. Continue uphill to an open space at the top.

Turn left on a grassy path into woods. Keep steeply down for some way to reach the back of Lynes Farm at the bottom. Here turn left on a footpath for ½ mile to reach a main road. Cross with care to continue up a drive at the other side. At a Y-fork bear right uphill and follow the track down to a cottage. Cross a gravel drive to an enclosed footpath with a stone wall on your left. Eventually cross a stile by a gate onto a road.

Turn left on the road for ¼ mile. Pass trees on your left. The road swings left and right. Look for a stile by a fieldgate on your left. Leave the road and walk forward to reach a field. Do not follow the hedge on your right but go diagonally left up and across the field to a wooden kissing gate. Enter another paddock and continue in the same diagonal direction to a stile by a fieldgate at the top.

Cross and turn immediately left to follow the field edge to a metal kissing gate. Go forward to soon reach a residential road. Turn right up this. Over the top of the hill, drop down to a T-junction. Turn right a few paces then left down an asphalt path between houses. Keep on down to reach a road at the bottom.

Turn left a short distance to reach the village green at Shamley Green. Cross to the Red Lion Inn and the end of the section.
