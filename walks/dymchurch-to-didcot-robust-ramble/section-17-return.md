With the ‘Nutley Arms’ on the left, go down the main road ½ mile (there is a pavement on the far side). Take the first road off on the left and continue along for ½ mile. Pass two side roads on the right and keep on to cross a bridge. Bear right with the road. Pass Beak House on the right and turn immediately right over a stile into a narrow footpath into woods.

At the far side exit over a broken stile into a field. Turn immediately left along the field edge and pass a pond on the left. At the corner bear right and continue to follow the hedge on the left (ignore a gap) down to the far bottom corner. Go through into the field beyond. Son reach a corner and cross a stile by a rusty fieldgate. Go forward past a pond on the right to a swing gate. Go through and up through woodland to a road. Go right on the road a few paces then left through a gate on an enclosed path up by the side of a cottage. At the top cross a stile into a playing field and keep on uphill with trees on the right. At the top go on into a wood.

On meeting a fence go forward with the fence on the left along a narrow path to a junction of ways. Here turn left up an enclosed path to a road. Bear right along the road for 100 metres. By the entrance to Lampool Farm cross to go left up the drive to Lampool Edge. Cross a cattle grid and enter an enclosed path by a wooden fieldgate. Continue on this enclosed path to a stile and exit into a field. Continue along with a hedge on the right.

Emerge onto a road through two stiles by metal fieldgates. Turn left for 100 metres looking for a stile on the right by a metal fieldgate with a ruined building beyond. Go down an enclosed footpath and soon over a stile to go down by horse paddocks. Keep on by the hedge on the right. Near the bottom of the field cross left to trees and go on along the bottom edge of the trees along the top of a narrow valley to reach a stile into woodland at the end.

Keep on through the wood to cross a railway sleeper foorbridge and come up to a junction of ways. Go right here down to a long footbridge then steeply up to eventually meet the Wealdway. Turn right and soon clamber up by rocks to a kissing gate into a field. Go up the field aiming left of a house ahead. Past the house bear right on a gravel track down past a vineyard on the right. Go through a gateway and bear left. Ignore a side path and stay on the Wealdway and on the gravel track along to a junction of ways in a farmyard. Turn right here and go down to a stile by a wooden fieldgate. Cross and continue downhill passing a house on the left.

At the bottom pass a stable building on the left. The gravel track turns sharp left. Leave it to go diagonally right across to a kissing gate. Go through and on in the same diagonal direction along by fence posts on the left (ignore and cross a track going down to horse paddocks). At the far opposite corner go through a kissing gate and down a path enclosed between horse paddocks towards a wood at the bottom.

Enter the wood and cross a footbridge then go steeply up. At the top leave the wood by a stile into a pasture. The official route goes forward across the pasture on the Wealdway to reach the main A26 road. It is necessary to turn left and follow the road for ¼ mile to a side road going off right.

This road is very dangerous. If possible, on leaving the wood go forward a few paces and turn left on a narrow path going along parallel with the wood on the left. Continue along all the way along the wood edge to the very far end (ignore the narrow path going off right). At the end step left into the wood and turn immediately right. There is no path but walk across towards the sound of traffic on the busy road. Drop down the bank to the side of the road. Cross with care to the side road opposite. Walk along the road for 150 metres looking for a large house on the left called Westrow House. Turn left here down the entrance drive to Stone House. Stay on the drive for some way. Eventually pass the gates of Stone House on the right soon afterwards turn right off the drive, up steps in a bank, to a stile. Go ahead between fences by a pasture on the left. At the end emerge at a meeting of tracks. Cross to a stile into a field and go on with a fence and trees on the right.

At the end cross a broken stile into a wood. Go down steps and bear left at the bottom along a secluded path. This emerges by farm buildings to go forward as a concrete track down to meet a road. Turn right up the road to a junction at the top. Turn right to soon reach ‘The Maypole’ pub and the start of the section.
