With ‘The Bramley’ pub on your left walk to the railway line and cross. Immediately over turn right to go down the side of a bakery and join a tarmac path between houses and the railway.

Walk along for some way then look out for the end of a road on your left by some thatched cottages. Turn left down this road and follow it past houses then on over Bramley Green. Eventually meet a main road by a post box. Go on along the main road in the same direction as before.

In a short distance turn left up Folly Lane. In 150 metres as the road climbs uphill, turn right onto a rough farm track and walk along heading for a distant pylon. Keep on the track for ½ mile with pleasant views, ignoring a footpath off right halfway along.

At the end emerge onto a road and turn right. In 50 metres cross a stream and immediately turn left into a drive to an equestrian centre. Go through a pedestrian gate and continue up the drive to Lilly Mill.

Here turn left on a vehicle track. Look out for a gate to a private car park on your right. Cross this to a footbridge and cross the River Loddon again. At the far side are two stiles. Bear over to the lefthand one and cross into a rough pasture.

Turn left and walk along by the fence on a feint path towards pylons. By the first pylon cross a footbridge and stile and go forward in the second field. At the far end bear right across to a farm bridge in the hedge. In the field beyond, bear diagonally left towards a pylon on a hill in the distance.

In the far top corner of the field, by several fieldgates, cross a stile into a garden area and walk along the top edge. Eventually emerge onto a tarmac drive by fisheries and turn right.

Walk up this drive to a junction with a road coming in from the right. Bear left, past the thatched Potters Cottage. At the end of the garden turn immediately left through an old gateway into a field corner. Go up the edge of the field towards a distant pylon.

At the end of the garden on your left, turn left out of the field over a grassy farm bridge into the adjoining field. Immediately turn right uphill along the field edge with a hedge on your right.

At the top corner of exit the field under power lines to a farm track. Turn left on this with a high hedge on your right. Walk along for 75 metres looking out for a gap in the hedge. Turn through this gap and walk through bushes to reach a field.

Go straight ahead across the field just right of a pylon to a hedge corner in the distance. Keep on in the same direction passing under power lines, and join a farm track along the bottom edge of a field with a hedge on your right.

Eventually the path exits onto a very busy main road. Cross with care and turn left. Pass a BP petrol station. Cross a side road and keep on up the main road. Soon reach the entrance to a recreation ground. Turn right into this and immediately left to follow the edge parallel to the road upto a children’s playground.

Exit the recreation ground onto the main road and immediately come to the car park of the ‘Jekyll & Hyde’ pub in Turgis Green and the start of the section.
