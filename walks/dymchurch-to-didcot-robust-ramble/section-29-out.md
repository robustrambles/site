  Distance/time: 5 miles/ 2 &#xBD; hours
  Start: Red Lion, Shamley Green
  Comment: >
    An excellent walk on quiet country paths through woodland and enclosed sandy paths. Virtually no stiles or road walking although this is hilly country. There are some attractive farmhouses and the special interest of walking part of the old railway line to Cranleigh and the River Wey towpath. Expect mud after significant rain.

Leave the Red Lion pub and cross the main road bearing left to the village shop. On reaching the shop turn right along the side road, alongside the village green, away from the main road. At the end of the green a road comes in from the right. Go ahead out of the village on the pavement of the road ahead.

In 150 metres, near the end of the houses on your right, by the entrance to Hullbrook, turn right up an enclosed surfaced path. Soon emerge onto a gravelled private road and continue up to a public road. Continue forward on this (Stonards Brow) to soon reach a sharp left turn. Turn left here, still on Stonards Brow, and follow the road down. Ignore a path off right between houses and keep on to emerge at the top of a green by Lords Hill House.

Bear right down a narrow road skirting the green to reach another road at the bottom. Turn right on this, soon passing a side road off left. In a few paces more go left off the road by a holly tree. Walk through woods to meet a farm road. Turn right on this.

Pass by farm buildings and continue on to pass a water treatment works. The track drops downhill and bears left to a bridge over the Wey canal. Cross the bridge and go up to and under an old railway bridge. Immediately turn right up the bank to join the path on the old railway line. Turn left and follow the path with the canal well down on your right, for a mile.

Eventually reach old level crossing gates and emerge onto a road. Turn left along the road to a crossroads by a petrol station. Here turn right up the main road for 100 metres looking for a path off on the left. Cross the road and go up here on a broad drive with walls either side and a grassy verge.

Continue up for some way. By the entrance to the last house on your right keep forward on a sunken bridleway. This goes steeply uphill. At the top turn right through a kissing gate onto a golf course.

Walk directly away from the kissing gate across the golf course to a waymark post. Continue between sandy bunkers to a further post then gently downhill through young trees to a tarmac path. Turn left on this between outbuildings and then across a car park and on downhill on a drive. Pass the Club House on your right and leave the golf course at the foot of the hill. Go forward, crossing a residential road and heading towards a busy main road in the distance.

Before reaching this, turn left on a grassy footpath through trees with a ditch and garden fences on your left. Soon reach a road. Cross to a track going on in the same direction past an elegant farmhouse. Keep on for some way; the track is easy to follow. Eventually reach a rough entrance drive. Go forward down this to a road.

Turn left down to a road bridge. Cross this and continue to a second bridge then on again to a third bridge over the River Wey. Immediately over this bridge turn left down onto the towpath. Follow this towards a right bend in the river. Just after a weir on a side stream leave the towpath and turn right on a broad grassy path into trees.

This soon passes a pond and reaches a wire fence on your right. Follow this fence all the way to a main road. Carefully turn left along the verge and soon reach the Manor Beefeater Inn and the end of the section.
