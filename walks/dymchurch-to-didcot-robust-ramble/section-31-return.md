With The Barley Mow pub on your left, continue on along the road ignoring side roads by the pub. Soon reach another crossroads and go straight across. Keep on to a Y-fork by a golf club house. Here turn right and follow the road along the edge of a golf course for ¼ mile to reach a footpath going off right over a footbridge.

Follow this path along between a hedge and a fence. This is part of the North Downs Way (NDW) and the route follows this for two miles. In ¼ mile reach a road. Cross over to continue on the NDW in the same direction. Walk along with a garden wall and fence on your left. Just after this finishes, fork right then left, still on the NDW. Follow a long stretch along the top edge of a field.

At the end reach a road. Cross, slightly right, to a path into woods, still NDW. Continue on an easy path. On a slightly downhill stretch reach a junction. Do not go straight ahead, but turn sharp left uphill with the NDW by a fence on your left.

Soon go through a wooden kissing gate and turn right along the top edge of a large sloping pasture. Eventually leave the field and continue through a wood. Cross a wide vehicle drive and continue through woods. At a junction of tracks swing right then left on a sunken track down through woods (NDW).

At a cottage at Toxford Hatch go a few paces left along a road, passing the front of the cottage, then turn right between fences. Soon cross a stream and in 10 metres turn right on a bridleway between wooden posts, finally leaving the NDW.

In a short distance the path rises to a Y-fork. Turn right here, downhill. Keep on the main sandy track ignoring paths off left and right. Soon the path is going uphill. Cross a cross track and go on uphill. At the top cross another cross track and go forward to a viewpoint. Continue on now steeply downhill on an eroded sandy path.

Near the bottom ignore a path coming in on your right. Go forward a few paces to a cross path. Here turn right on a wide muddy track. Keep on down through silver birches. After some way a narrow bridleway crosses. Turn left on this (there is a wooden post with a blue waymark).

Stay on this path for ¼ mile through woods. Cross three cross paths. After the third crossing the path becomes rather feint and begins to climb. Eventually emerge onto a road by a new sandstone house. Turn left on the road for 200 metres. Cross a side road and keep on up the road. At the top opposite the entrance to a car park, turn right off the road onto a footpath.

Skirt a cottage and drop steeply down steps to a sunken bridleway. Turn left on this for a few paces then turn right off it on a footpath up the bank. This continues in a straight and easy fashion for ¾ mile. Eventually cross two stiles to emerge onto a road.

Turn right on the road. Immediately after passing a large duckpond turn right on a byway. This curves around Lydling Farm. Where the high garden wall on your right drops down, turn left up a vehicle track passing cottages. Where the track ends by a house on your left, go on to cross a stile into a field.

Go down the field with a hedge and fence on your left. At the bottom corner cross a stile by a fieldgate into a further field and keep on with the hedge on your left. On reaching another stile, cross into an enclosed path which soon emerges onto a road.

Turn left up the road to a T-junction. Turn right to a second junction by the village shop. Turn right to soon return to The Cyder Inn and the start of the section.
