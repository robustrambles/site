From the car park of the Manor Inn turn left along the main road towards Godalming. In 50 metres look out for the entrance to Bunker’s Hill Farm on your left. Turn down here and soon reach the River Wey. Turn right down onto the towpath and follow it for some way to reach a road bridge at Farncombe Boat House.

Cross the road and return to the towpath to pass Catteshall Lock. Keep along for some way to eventually reach another bridge(Town Bridge) and road by a church in Godalming. Climb up to the road and cross with care. Turn left over the bridge and immediately turn right by the library on a tarmac path back alongside the river. Again continue for some way to a further bridge over the river below Godalming parish church.

Carefully cross the road and turn right to cross the bridge, keep on to reach a railway bridge. Go under this and turn immediately left on a footpath by a stream. Soon reach the access road to works. Cross and continue on along the path by the stream. Soon the River Wey joins on your left.

After some distance the path turns away from the river. At a footbridge before an upward slope, turn left on a grassy footpath by a ditch and under power lines, with houses up on your right. Continue to a path junction by a brick WW2 pill box. Here turn right up by the side of houses to reach a road end.

Here turn left on a footpath by a wall into trees. Follow this for ½ mile. Eventually pass a house and exit through gates onto a drive. Bear right up this to soon reach a junction of ways by a corner of stone walling.

Here turn left down a bridleway through woods. The path is easy to follow along a secluded valley with impressive wetlands down on your left. The unmade surface turns to compacted stone chippings halfway along and, through a gate by a pill box, goes on along a concrete farm track. Eventually reach a road at Lower Eashing. Turn right towards main A3 road.

Just before the slip road, by a petrol station, turn right up a bridleway and cross the bridge over the dual carriageway. At the far side drop down to a metal fieldgate into a field. Bear right up the side of the field by a wire fence on your right. At the top corner turn left to still follow the fence along to the next corner by trees.

Go through an equestrian gate and in a few paces turn left through the belt of trees to a stile. Cross into a field and go straight ahead up the slope. Over the brow of the hill drop down towards the buildings of Peper Harrow. Pass a barn to reach a gateway onto a private road.

Turn right up the road passing a pond on your right and the church (currently being restored) on your left. Keep on past interesting buildings uphill to reach a T-junction (ignore a footpath into the field on your left).

Turn right for a few paces and turn left up Peper Harrow Lane. In ¼ mile reach The Cyder Inn in the village of Shackleford and the end of the section.
