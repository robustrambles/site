With the Plume of Feathers on your left, go on along Well Road. Just before the last house on the left, at Potter’s Hill, go left through a gate and up towards a church. Pass along the edge of a cricket pitch and emerge onto a road in front of the church at the top. Turn left a short distance to a road junction. Turn right on an enclosed path hidden between the end of the churchyard and a school. Go up between a wall and a hedge.

Keep on for some way. Just before entering a field, go left between a hedge and gardens on your left, and follow down to a road. Turn right down the road. At a junction bear right and soon reach a T-junction.

Turn right along the road for 200 metres (ignore a footpath off left). Keep onto a sharp left bend in the road. Here turn right along a private road to Clare Park Farm. Pass the farmhouse and continue on a concrete road between hedges. Pass a second farm. Where surfaced road swings left, go straight on up a farm track between hedges. Climb steeply up then down to a road. Turn left for ½ mile on a narrow country road.

Keep right at a Y-fork and continue to a second Y-fork by a footpath off right. Stay on the road bearing right and on to another Y-fork. This time bear left downhill. Pass Millars Cottage and turn right off the road through double fieldgates along the top edge of a sloping field.

Keep on along the headland (ignore a path off left) with excellent views. AS the path descends a hedge comes in on the left. At a corner drop down muddy steps to a stile. Cross and continue along with the hedge on your right. At the far end cross a stile in a muddy corner to a track. Cross to go down an enclosed path. At the bottom cross a grassy area to a footbridge and go on up a steep flight of steps. At the top go forward to a rough vehicle track. Turn left on this.

Soon reach a road junction. Cross over to continue forward along Waynefleet Lane. Follow this through houses to a T-junction with a main road (Crondall Road). Turn right to a pedestrian crossing. Cross and turn right downhill past Beavers Close to reach Beavers Road just beyond. Turn left along here.

Just after a school on your right, opposite a college, turn right down a side road called Potters Gate. A short way down by Austin Cottages, turn left off the road into an alley way. Follow this all the way along until it eventually emerges onto a road with a car park ahead.

Turn right down the road to a T-junction with a main road. Turn left here and keep along to the Queen’s Head and the start of the section.
