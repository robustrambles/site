  Comment: >
    A fairly short and easy walk except for the section up to Pitch Hill which is a steep climb followed by a very steep descent on a feint path. This should not be attempted in wet or misty weather or when visibility is poor. It is not suitable for young children, anyone with restricted mobility or the faint-hearted ! An alternative along the road is provided. For those making the climb the views are tremendous.

With the Hurtwood Inn on your right, go up the road away from the village centre. Ignore a footpath off on your right. Soon pass the village hall on your right then St. Mary’s Church on your left. Immediately past the church turn left off the road up a green slope towards gates. Just before the gates turn right, steeply uphill, to reach a barrier and a cross path.

Turn right on this and walk down to reach a road. Go forward a few paces then turn left into a car parking area. Walk up this car park to the far end. Leave the car park passing a noticeboard and wooden barrier. The walk stays on this bridle way in the same direction for a mile.

At two Y-forks bear right and ignore all cross and side paths. Keep on always gently rising to eventually emerge into the bottom end of a car park. Go up the car park to the road entrance. The path to Pitch Hill (part of the Greensand Way) goes straight ahead here. (If not attempting the climb and descent go out onto the road and turn left with care for ¼ mile. Ignore the first bridgeway going off on your right and look out for a second going sharply down a drive at Copse Hill).

Otherwise take the path which climbs steeply up Pitch Hill and emerge at the top by an old Ordnance Survey concrete trig point and splendid views. Keep on along the top a short way to where the Greensand Way turns right back into trees. Here, by a second viewpoint, turn right downhill on a narrow path.

It is clear to start with but then bears slightly right and becomes concealed by bracken. Go carefully parting the bracken to make sure that you always follow the path. Although narrow it is flattened by use. Do not wander into untrodden areas. Eventually reach a narrow road at the bottom. Turn right on this down to a T-junction with a busier road. Turn right on this. In 50 metres turn sharp left on a drive by Copse Hill. Go down this drive a short way. Where the asphalt stops go forward on a narrower track to pass a house on your left. Continue down through woods for some way. The path becomes sunken and eroded. Eventually emerge onto a vehicle drive at Rapsley Farm. Go past the farm and stay on the asphalt drive for some way.

At a T-junction bear left a few paces the turn off right across to a stile by a wooden fieldgate. Cross into a woodland path. This is easily followed for some way although aggressive fencing makes it very narrow. Go up steps midway and later cross a stile. Eventually reach a further stile and emerge onto a drive.

Turn left on this drive and follow it for ½ mile to emerge by a green in Ewhurst with the Bulls Head beyond and the start of the section.
