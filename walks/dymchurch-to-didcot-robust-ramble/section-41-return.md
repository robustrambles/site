  Distance/Time: 5 miles/ 2.5 hours
  Start: The former Winning Hand pub, now closed, on the A4 near Ufton lock (if making the circular walk, start back from Ufton Lock)
  Comment: >
    An excellent walk along fields in quiet country. The complex water management at Padworth Mill is interesting. A short diversion north can be made here to refreshment at Aldermaston Wharf if required. Fisherman&#x2019;s Lane is an easy final lap.

From The Winning Hand recross the main road and go back down the road opposite to the Kennet & Avon Canal. Cross over and continue on the road for ½ mile. At a Y-fork bear right.

In 100 metres, halfway up a hill, go right over a stile in the hedge. Follow the hedge on your right a short way. Where this ends go straight ahead across the open field. At the bottom go through a gap into the next field and continue following the hedge on your right.

At the end continue into the next field by a fallen tree trunk and go on by woods on your right. At the end meet a farm track. Turn right down this a short way. Near the bottom of the slope, turn left to walk along the bottom edge of the field with trees on your right.

At a corner cross a plank bridge and continue straight across the field ahead. At the far side enter an enclosed grassy track between trees. At the end emerge onto a road past a metal barrier.

Turn right on the road for 50 metres. Cross Padworth Bridge and immediately turn left down steps to join a grassy path by a wire fence on your right and gravel pits beyond.

On reaching Padworth Mill turn right on a gravel drive for 10 metres then left, by the entrance to Mill House, into a narrow enclosed path between a hedge and a tall wooden fence. Cross several bridges and sluices noting the fish ladder which is part of a project to reintroduce salmon to the River Kennet.

At the far side go through a wooden kissing gate and up a grassy way between wire fences to a footbridge and gate into a field. Turn immediately right and walk along field edge with a fence on your right. This is the beginning of Fisherman’s Lane which goes straight to Aldermaston Village.

At a corner cross a footbridge and continue along the top of the next field to a kissing gate at the far side by a metal fieldgate. Keep on along a farm track lined by trees. Ignore all side paths as this area is part of a Stewardship Scheme with permissive paths.

Pass Fisherman’s Cottage and remain on the easily followed track all the way back to emerge at a road junction in the centre of Aldermaston Village with The Hind’s Head opposite and the start of the section.
