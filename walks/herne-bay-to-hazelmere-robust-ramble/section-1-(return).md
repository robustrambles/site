  Comment: >
    Some nice country to begin with followed by some gentle weaving around the creeping development of Herne village. Then quiet road walking from Herne Mill. This is high on the hill so some views as you go. A very long footbridge leads back to a former country lane, Eddington Lane, and the footpath under the railway, to Herne Bay Station.

Leave the Curious Cat pub and regain the main road. Turn left and soon find a footpath on your left just before a Cattery.

Walk down an enclosed path and emerge onto a road. Go straight over to a footpath opposite. Keep down and over a footbridge, then bear left on a narrow and boggy path along the edge of gardens.

Cross a stile into a field and keep on down the edge with a hedge on your left.

Near the bottom corner, turn left, through a gap in the hedge and over a footbridge to a path junction.

Turn left, uphill, with the hedge on your left and a fence on the right.

On approaching houses, cross a stile and continue up to cross another stile onto a road.

Cross to a tarmac path opposite and go down through houses. On reaching Curtis Wood Park Road, follow the road down.

Where the road bears left down to a main road, turn right up a side road, passing a pond on the left. Stay on the road, steeply uphill. At a T-junction, turn left downhill.

Reach a main road and turn right a few paces (no pavement and on a bend – a dangerous moment). Soon turn uphill on a side road to Chapel Row. At the top continue on a path.

At a T-junction with a school beyond, turn right a few paces, then left along an enclosed path. Keep along turning left then right, out to a road.

Cross to go up the road opposite. Bear right at the top then look for an enclosed path off left between bungalows.

Enter and cross an open field to a broken stile at the far side. Continue on with trees on your right.

Cross a stile onto a vehicle drive and turn left uphill.

Reach a main road and cross to go up Hawe Farm Way. Near the top turn left along Charnwood Road. At the top turn right on an enclosed path and follow it out to a road. Notice Herne Mill across opposite. Turn right on the road.

In 200 metres reach a crossroads. Turn left down Pigeon Lane to the very bottom.

Go forward onto a very long footbridge crossing a dual carriageway. At the end drop down to a main road.

Turn right a few paces then cross to turn left along Eddington Lane. In about ½ mile reach a roundabout.

Turn right between business units, still on Eddington Lane. In 100 metres turn right on an enclosed path (used on outward route) and go along and under the railway to reach Station Approach. Turn left up to Herne Bay Station and the start of the section.
