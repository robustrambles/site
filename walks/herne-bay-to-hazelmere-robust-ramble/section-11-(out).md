title: Section 11 (Out)
subtitle: Boughton Lees to Challock
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye'
  'Total Circular Distance': '7 miles/4 hours'
  Start: 'Parking around the village green at Boughton Lees'
  Comment: 'A varied walk with fields and parkland. Basically climbing all the way to Challock, steady but no extreme slopes. The church at Challock unfortunately is locked with the key available from The Barn Farm shop over a mile away and ahead. The Flying Horse pub at Brabourne Lees is closed on Mondays but the Stag at Challock is open every day. This section is quite short but the return is considerably longer.'

With the Flying Horse behind, walk across the centre of the cricket pitch and green to the war memorial cross and on to the end of grass at a road junction.

Carefully bear right to cross the main road to the church opposite. Turn left past the church and then immediately right, up the bank through the hedge to a broken wooden kissing gate.

Go forward across the grass, away from the road, on the North Downs Way. Exit onto an hotel drive. Cross diagonally right, and continue up a rising pasture. At the top turn right with a wire fence on your left.

On approaching an elevated water tank, meet a cross path. Turn right down this. At the bottom emerge onto an estate road and cross to a metal kissing gate. Bear slightly diagonally right up a rising field, aiming towards the edge of trees at the very top.

Meet a farm track at the top of the field and go forward still uphill. Continue to the top of the hill skirting woods on your left.

At the very top, by a stone seat, Challock Church appears in the valley below. A path should run down the field to the church from here, but you must go on down 20 metres to find the waymark pointing towards the church (stay on the farm track if the filed is not walkable).

Enter the churchyard and turn left, past the church, to the car park. Exit down to the end of a rough country road and turn right, past the manor house.

Keep on the road steeply uphill. At the top pass a school on your right. Reach an area of grass on the right with a war memorial cross. Turn right on the road here. Follow it all the way past the village hall and cricket pitch to emerge onto a main road. Cross and turn left a short distance to The Stag pub at Challock roundabout.
