From the Punch Tavern, cross the main road with care and turn right on the pavement. In 80 metres, by a bungalow, turn right, to cross the road again and go into Woodlands Farm entrance.

Where the drive swings right, at the entrance to Bird’s Nest, bear left on a stoney farm track, circling past the farm over on your right, then forward for ½ mile along a field edge with a solar farm on your right.

At the bottom corner, bear left across scrub, to a footbridge and cross to a metal gate into a field. Turn left up the edge with a hedge on your left.

At a corner, cross a footbridge and turn right up the field edge with a hedge on your right. Emerge through a gate and footbridge onto a road. Cross and continue on a narrow path through trees and bushes.

Emerge from these and continue across an open field. At a corner of woods ahead, ignore a cross path and continue forward, along the side of a field with the woods on your right.

At a corner and junction of paths, turn right, into the woods, then almost immediately left. Keep on steadily down through the wood to eventually reach a footbridge.

Cross and turn left along the edge of the wood, now on your left, along an enclosed muddy path.

In 50 metres, turn left, over a footbridge in the hedge, into a field. Turn right up the edge with a hedge on your right.

At the top, cross a stile into an enclosed and muddy path, around the foot of gardens. Cross a footbridge then a stile to a road.

Go straight over and up the footpath opposite to reach a main road. Turn right a short distance to reach the Curious Cat pub and start of the section.
