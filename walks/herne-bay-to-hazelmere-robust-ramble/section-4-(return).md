title: Section 4 (Return)
subtitle: Littlebourne to Fordwich
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet'
  Total Circular Distance: '5 miles/3 hours'
  Start: 'From the Evenhill pub in Littlebourne, parking if intending to take refreshment here.'
  Comment: >
    A shortish walk mostly in woodland with a final cruise down the side of open fields into Fordwich. There is a short but tricky section on narrow enclosed paths with stiles before the open field ending. Be careful crossing the country roads. They are rat-runs.

From the Evenhill pub, turn right, back up the main road. At the top of the hill, turn right into woods, by a barrier, then turn quickly left on a footpath.

Reach a cross a track. Turn left then immediately right and on in the same direction as before.

Reach a solar farm. The path diverts left along the fence and soon right down an enclosed path between hedges.

At the bottom enter woods and soon reach a road. Cross and continue.

Reach a concrete parking area and continue downhill on a vehicle track. Soon, by a wooden telegraph pole on your right, bear right to a path downhill into woods.

Cross a footbridge and continue, slightly right, uphill, across an open field. At the top enter woods.

After some way, when approaching sheds, ahead left, cross a cross track and immediately turn left along the side of a shed, and over a stile into a paddock.

Go diagonally left across the centre to the far opposite corner. Here cross a stile and continue along an enclosed leafy path. Emerge at a road junction (narrow country roads but a busy rat-run so care needed).

Turn left for 10 metres looking for a concealed footpath off right into bushes. Follow this down the back of houses.

Continue down the side of paddocks, parallel with power lines on your left.

At the bottom corner turn right (not a PROW but a well- used path). Keep through bushes as the path bears left and emerges at a field corner with double metal fieldgates on your right.

Go forward down the edge of the field, with a hedge on the right, for Â¼ mile. Dog-leg left and right around a house, halfway, still on field edge. Ignore all side paths out of the field.

Finally, in the very bottom corner of the field, cross a stile by a wooden fieldgate. Continue down past houses to a road corner. The George & Dragon at the start of the section, is immediately ahead.
