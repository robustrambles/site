details:
  Map: 'Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye'

  Start: 'Parking at the Red Lion by arrangement. The Plough Inn at Stalisfield Green is not open on Mondays; the Red Lion every day.'
  Comment: 'A varied walk with pasture and woodland paths, great rolling fields with excellent views. Several fields had not reinstated paths through growing crops which slows progress. Some short steep climbs. This is isolated countryside so make sure you have left details of your route.'

From the car park of the Red Lion pub carefully cross the main road and turn left along to a metal fieldgate and equestrian gate on the right (last few metres of road have no verge).

Go through into a large pasture and aim diagonally left across the centre past a pylon and under power lines to opposite bottom corner.

Exit through an equestrian gate and bear diagonally left up the field ahead aiming just right of a stand of trees.

Past the trees try and keep on the same line across the top of the field to a waymark post sitting on a bridleway.

Turn right on the bridleway and go up with field on the left and treeline on the right.

Pass by the end of a hedge on the left and enter the top field. Continue up the edge for 80 metres to where the track begins to descend.

Here turn diagonally left across this huge field towards the righthand side of distant farm buildings in trees(no reinstatement of path).

On nearing the buildings bear right of them, including a wooden fieldgate, and search in the bushes on the right for a concealed path through to a road.

Turn left up to a junction and here go left again. N a short distance the road bends left. Here turn sharp right on a wide gravel track.

On reaching trees, turn left on a bridleway going along the top of a sloping field with a hedge on the left.

Where the hedge ends continue on the track across the open field. On reach a hedge at the far side, go through a gap into a field corner beyond.

Bear right to continue as before parallel to hedge on the right. Halfway along bear right through the hedge by old farm machinery and turn immediately left to follow the hedge, now on your left.

Reach and pass a barn on your right to come to a T-junction. Turn right, past the barn and go straight down the field ahead. Pass a telegraph pole but do not follow the wires as they swing off right.

At the top find a gap in  the hedge and go forward I nto a wood.

Leave the wood to pass a house and garden on the right. Join a drive for a short distance before turning left through a metal kissing gate into a pasture, bear diagonally right across the corner to a black metal kissing gate in the hedge at the far side.

Go through to a road. Cross to a gap and continue forward between fields under telephone wires. At the faf side go towards a house and exit through a gap on to a road.

Turn left along to a junction. Here turn right. In a short distance follow road around left bend and downhill.

At the bottom two bridleways go off left. Pass both of these and look for a feint path in the trees on the side of the road as it turns uphill (if you look carefully there is an old concrete footpath marker in the vegetation).

Make your way up to the field above as quickly as you can. Reach another huge uphill field. Bear diagonally left uphill and across the field to a farm roof just visible on the skyline (no crop reinstatement).

Eventually reach the corner of the first building. Here bear left down the side of the buildings to reach the field beyond. Turn right along the edge and pass all the buildings on your right. Keep on down the field looking for a gap through the hedge into a churchyard.

Go down past the church to the lychgate and go through to a road. Cross straight over and go down a leafy path beyond.

Exit the wood into a field at the bottom and continue up bearing very slightly left (no reinstatement) to a waymark post at the top.

Enter woods on a pleasant path. At the far side go straight across another field (no reinstatement) to woods at the far side.

Reach a metal swing gate in to a pasture and bear slightly left across the corner to a second gate.

Go steeply down through woods. At the very bottom cross a bridleway and continue steeply up through woods.

Near the top ignore a path off left and continue to a metal kissing gate into a field. Go straight across under wires to exit onto a road.

Turn right a few paces then left up a side road. At a junction bear right and soon see the Plough Inn ahead in Stalisfield Green and end of the section.
