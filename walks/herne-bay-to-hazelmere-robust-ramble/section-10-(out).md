  Comment: 'A mixed walk with a variety of country paths and excellent views in very quiet country. The outward section is mostly across arable fields and generally flat, there are several footbridges. Be careful crossing the A28 and notice the slight deviation, right, to the farm access. There is a railway crossing and a river crossing.'

From the Tickled Trout pub turn left, uphill on Bridge Street, the road going directly up into Wye. This is a one-way street.

Immediately past the Village Hall, turn right up the car park entrance. Keep to the left edge, past a school entrance on the left and a recreation ground on your right.

At the end of the tarmac roadway, bear left through a wooden swing gate, then immediately right, up through trees passing another playing field on your left.

In the top corner go through a wooden kissing gate and on, through scrub.

Reach a field and continue straight ahead.

Cross a footbridge into the next field and keep on.

Leave the field as you pass a pond on your right and bear right across the corner of the field ahead.

Cross another footbridge and keep on, across the field to a long, ageing footbridge over the Great Stour River.

Over this, go straight up the field to a fence along the railway at the top side. The path should actually bear left in mid-field and go diagonally left up to the top left corner. However, it is easier to go straight up to the railway fence, then turn left 100 metres along to the corner.

Here find a railway crossing. At the other side turn immediately left on a grassy way along by the railway on your left.

At the end of the fence on your right, turn right, up to another footbridge into the corner of a field.

Now turn diagonally left, across the centre of the field to a post by a bush at the far side.

On reaching the post, turn right up to a main road. Cross with care as the traffic is fast. Bear right a few paces to a farm entrance at Wilmington Farm.

Go up past farm buildings to continue up the edge of a field. Just past the last of the farm buildings on your right, reach a cross path.

Turn right to cross the field on your right towards a farm and an oast.

Exit the field onto a driveway. Turn left on this a short distance. Just before the oast, turn diagonally right, uphill, across the open field.

At the far opposite corner go through bushes and on across the field beyond.

Go through the far hedge and on, in the same direction, with a wire fence on your right, to a metal fieldgate ahead.

Beyond this gate soon emerge onto the village green at Boughton Lees and cross to the Flying Horse pub opposite.
