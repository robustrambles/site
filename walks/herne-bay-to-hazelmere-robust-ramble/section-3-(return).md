    From the George & Dragon walk back towards the main road in Sturry. Ignore the footpath off right immediately over the river bridge. Keep back down until in sight of the main road junction. Turn right along the footpath noticed on the outward route, going off between a bungalow and a house.

    Soon ignore a footpath off left and keep forward into scrub. Emerge at a concrete access road. Ignore this access road and turn immediately left, upto a metal fieldgate and on up the side of a playing field.

    At top corner turn right to continue along the top edge. Keep on by a miniature railway track on your right, looking out for a gap in the hedge on your left leading to a crossing of the main line railway.

    Join an enclosed path, then, in a few paces, left, up another enclosed path to a main road in Sturry.

    Cross with care and turn left. Take the first road off right uphill. Look out for Delaware Close going off left and turn into this.

    At the end of the close bear right to a footpath going up into a garage area. Join the access road, left, to a junction. Turn left for 10 metres, then right, up a footpath through trees.

    Reach a road. Cross to the footpath opposite and continue up. This becomes a road. Follow it all the way round to a T-junction. Turn right, then first left into Hillbrow Avenue, to reach another T-junction.

    Turn right for 150 metres.

    There is a field on your left. Look for a stile on the left into the corner of this field. Go up the edge of the field with a fence on your right.

    Enter woodland to soon reach a wooden kissing gate. Go diagonally right, down the meadow to enter woods at the bottom.

    Leave the wood over a footbridge. Turn right along the field edge with the woods on your right. Where the trees stop, turn left, down and across the field, under power lines.

    At the bottom, cross a broken stile and go forward to a footbridge.

    Over this turn sharply diagonally right on a feint path up and across the bottom section of the field.

    Reach and cross a stile in the fence ahead and continue straight over the next field.

    At the far side, turn left up the edge. At the top corner turn right on a farm track. In 100 metres, look for a stile in the fence on the left.

    Cross and turn sharply diagonally left across the field.

    At the far side cross a footbridge and stile in bushes. Continue slightly right across the next field.

    Cross a stile at the far side and continue, again slightly right, across a large field.

    At the far side bear right to a gap in the hedge ahead (ignore a path going left into thick bushes).

    Go through gap to a sloping field and bear diagonally right downhill to a gap in the bottom hedge. Go through and straight up the field beyond towards a white house.

    Go through bushes at the top to emerge onto the main road at Calcott. Cross with care and turn right along the pavement to soon reach The Punch Tavern and start of the section.
