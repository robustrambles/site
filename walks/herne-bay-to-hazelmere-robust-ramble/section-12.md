Section 12 Out

Challock to Badlesmere

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: Parking at the village hall by the cricket pitch or at The Stag by arrangement.

Comment: A varied walk with fields and woodland paths This route requires some zig-zagging including crossing the main A251 Faversham Ashford Road. This needs great care. There is also a short stretch of actual road walking on the rat-run road to Charing with fast traffic. Essential to use the rough verges. Several of these paths are little used so need careful mapwork. The Red Lion at Badlesmere is open everyday.

From The Stag pub, cross the road by the roundabout and walk along the Faversham road passing a car sales site on your right.

Go along the lefthand pavement and soon turn left into Mill Lane. In some way along, just past new building over on your left, reach a crosspath.

Turn right on this into a field. Go straight across the field passing a wooden telegraph pole on your right as you go.

Reach a hedge at the far side. Go through a gap to drop down onto a cross track. Turn right.

On reaching an open space by a field entrance on the left, bear left through a gap between holly bushes into a field corner.

Go diagonally across the centre of the field towards the righthand end of the gap between two rows of conifer trees.

Cross a stile into a paddock and go forward. Continue through metal gates and further paddocks. Finally weave through the garden of a farmhouse out to a lane.

Turn right along to a main road. Cross to Pested Lane opposite.

Go up the lane to a Y-fork. Here bear left. Just past a house on your right, look for an unmarked gap in the hedge on the left. Go through to a field.

Cross the field, diagonally right, aiming for the righthand end of an assorted treeline in the distance. Find an open field entrance onto a main road.

Cross with great care to an opposite entrance into the field over the road.

Again bear diagonally right across a huge field towards . the distant Broomfield Farm.

In the opposite corner of the field drop down a bank to enter the field leading to the farm. Continue diagonally towards barns.

At the far side reach a metal fieldgate. Go through (possibly having to climb over) and continue diagonally across the farmyard. Go between barns to a metal fieldgate into a pasture beyond.

Go straight ahead from the fieldgate across to another metal fieldgate at the far side.

Enter a wood and go diagonally left, downhill. Keep all the way down to an occasionally busy road.

Turn right and follow the road around and uphill to reach a house on the right. There is a rough verge on the far side and it is essential to use this.

Opposite the house, turn left off the road onto a path into a huge field. Cross, slightly diagonally right, aiming just right of large barns.

Cross the field to the very far opposite corner. Pass an outbuilding on your right just before the corner, then reach a stile in the corner itself, among trees. The barns are just beyond.

Cross the stile and turn immediately left along the hedge on your left to a metal equestrian gate by a metal fieldgate. Continue down a pasture.

Follow a feint tractor track which curves gently right across the corner ahead and drops down to another metal equestrian gate at the very bottom.

Go through. (The PROW goes 200 metres up the hill ahead and then, beyond a stand of trees on the right, turns right onto a path dropping diagonally right, down the field on the right to the bottom edge.).

Otherwise, if the crop allows, from the equestrian gate, turn right along the bottom edge of the field on your right.

Go all the way along to pass a point where telephone wires on wooden poles pass overhead and go on towards power cables and pylons ahead.

Look for a waymark post and equestrian gate in bushes on the right. Go through and steeply uphill towards a pylon.

Enter a large pasture and go slightly diagonally left across to the far side. Pass buildings on your left. Inn the corner by the last building, cross onto a busy main road.

Turn left with care to cross to The Red Lion pub in Badlesmere and the end of the section.

Badlesmere to Challock

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: Parking at Red Lion by arrangement

Comment: Open Access land to start then varied footpaths through quiet countryside. Careful wayfinding needed halfway.

From the entrance at the side of the Red Lion walk across the car park to a gap in the hedge and turn right on a byway lane. Walk away from the main road.

Continue down the lane passing houses. The lane turns right as a bridleway. Ignore this and keep straight on,  over grass, and along the edge of the green (the Lees) with trees on your right.

Stay along this edge following it around to a wooden fieldgate. Go through into a large meadow with power lines beyond.

Turn left along the edge towards a pylon in the valley ahead.

Go downhill to a stile then on past the pylon and uphill. Emerge on to a road at the top. Turn left a few paces, then right, up a bank, onto a narrow mossy path through trees.

Exit over a stile, in to a pasture. Cross diagonally left to a stile at the far side.

Cross and bear right along the field edge with trees on your right. At a corner, bear diagonally left across a huge field well left of farm buildings ahead.

100metres left of a large barn, find a gap in the hedge. Go through and cross a farm road.

Path should go straight down along hedge on right to a waymark post, then diagonally left across huge field. Currently the path is reinstated directly diagonally left from the corner. Head diagonally across the field towards a roof in the valley in the distance.

Reach a road by Pontus. Cross to a path beyond, heading towards a church tower.

On nearing a hedge, DO NOT GO THROUGH, but turn       sharp diagonally right, back across the field to the right     of a farm (currently marked directly rather than the PROW route). Exit onto a road by wooden power poles.

Turn left on the road, past the farm to a junction. Bear left on the road a few paces, then turn right under metal field barriers into a field corner.

Go straight down the side of the field with the hedge on your right. At the bottom the field edge curves left  and the hedge disappears.

Here bear right, out of the field, up the bank into the field up ahead. Continue slightly left up the field edge with hedge and trees on your left (the PROW cuts across the corner of the field). Go up to the very top of the field.

Where the trees on the left end, go straight on across the open field to exit onto a road. Turn right.

Just before the first house, turn left over a stile into a paddock. Bear diagonally left on a grassy way between fences. Reach a stile into woods.

Cross and follow a feint path through the trees. Ignore a path in from the left and keep on gently rightwards through the woods.

Near the top of the rise, ignore a cross path. Exit the wood over a stile into a grass meadow with houses over on the left and new houses ahead.

Go straight up the field looking for a stile into a path enclosed between tall wooden fences.

At the end turn right through a car sales area to reach a main road.

Turn left to the roundabout at Challock crossroads. Cross with care to The Stag pub opposite and start of the section.
