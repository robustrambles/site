Leave Chalkpit Farm shop complex to reach the public road. Turn left with care along the grassy verge.

In 50 metres reach a wood on your left. Look for a path up into the wood and turn immediately right along the edge of the wood with the road down on your right.

At the end of the wood, turn left on a public footpath with a fence on your right. Bear right down past the church then through the lychgate and down to a narrow road.

Cross the road and then a footbridge. Bear right to a metal kissing gate into the field opposite.

Go diagonally right across the centre of the field to a stile in the far opposite corner out to a road. Turn left down to a T-junction with a main road.

Cross and turn right under a railway bridge. Join a footpath turning left up the side of the railway.

Pass the station at the top and bear right, still on a footpath. Keep in a direct line past a car park, then on, on an enclosed path to a road.

Turn left up the road for 50 metres. Just past a farm entrance on your right, turn right on a gravel track.

At the end bear right to a concealed path dropping down through bushes, then on, up a path lined by splendid beech trees.

Emerge into the corner of a field of poly tunnels. Go up the side with a hedge on your right.

Where the hedge ends (just before the top of the field), turn left on a cross path down between poly tunnels.

At the bottom, keep on beyond the polytunnels to a hidden stile in the very bottom corner. Cross and keep forward across a meadow.

At the far side go through a wooden equestrian gate and turn sharp right into a farmyard, then straight on past the farm office.

On reaching the Kent Pip cider barn straight ahead (sometimes open for refreshment), follow the farm track around to the left then up and around to the right.

Keep on this farm road for Â½ mile past orchards and cottages half way.

At the very end reach a main road. Turn right a few paces and cross with care to turn left into woods past a rusty fieldgate.

In 100 metres turn right on a cross path and follow through to the edge of the wood at the far side. Turn right out to a main road.

Turn left on the pavement down the roadside and soon reach the Evenhill pub in Littlebourne and the start of the section.
