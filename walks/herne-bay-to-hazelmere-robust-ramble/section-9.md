Section 9 Out

Hastingleigh to Wye

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: Very limited on-road parking in Hastingleigh by the village pond.

Comment: A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and excellent views in very quiet country. Hilly country so expect steep climbs. Several stiles to negotiate but mostly kissing gates. Long decline into Wye.

From the north side of the pond in Hastingleigh turn right on the road heading out of the village past a gothick style house called Southview.

A short distance up the road, turn first left up a gravel farm track passing houses over on your right.

Pass the entrance to a playing field also on the right. In 10 metres further, leave the track, which continues straight ahead, and turn left into a field entrance.

Follow down the edge of the field with a wood on your right. Where the trees finish, continue steeply uphill on a grassy track.

Go forward into a further field at the top, with a hedge on your right. Keep on, past woods on the right, until the path finally bears right into the trees and soon emerges at a road junction.

Ignore the ‘no through road’ down to the right and go forward on the main road, past a house on the right.

At a T-junction. Go straight across to a path by a metal barrier. Go forward along the field edge with trees on the right.

Where trees end, continue across an open pasture to meet a lane, designated a byway.

Turn left along the lane. Pass down the edge of a field on your right. Just past the field corner ahead, turn right on a gravel drive, past a wooden fieldgate. Where the drive soon swings left, go through a metal kissing gate and on, slightly left, across scrub, to a second metal kissing gate.

Follow a grassy path to a stile. Drop down, slightly diagonally left, to a stile by a metal fieldgate.

Continue downhill on a wide grassy way with a wire fence on your left. Go through a metal fieldgate and on down.

Over the next stile, turn sharp left, down by a fence on your left, to a wooden swing gate, then on across the valley.

Continue up the far side, then gradually right, around the bottom edge of a wood, for some distance.

Eventually cross a drive and go forward, again skirting the bottom side of a second wood, with a field on your right.

At a corner, leave the field edge and go straight up on a steep path through woods. Reach a metal kissing gate at the top with a field ahead.

Go straight across the field to a metal kissing gate in the fence at the far side. Join the North Downs Way and turn right along it.

Keep straight along the top of the downs to a black kissing gate. Continue forward over Wye Crown with splendid views.

Over the brow and having passed a memorial to Queen Elizabeth II, reach a metal kissing gate at a junction of paths on the edge of a wood.

Leave the NDW and go straight ahead through the kissing gate and into the wood (this is a well-used path but not a PROW).

Gradually drop down through the wood to rejoin the NDW at the far side. Bear left on it, to go very steeply downhill.

Eventually leave the wood and continue downhill along a field edge. Reach a road. Cross and continue in the same direction.

Nearing the bottom pass by abandoned business units to finally reach a road.

Cross and go straight ahead (leave the NDW which goes off left down into the centre of Wye) down a broad drive between wide grass verges.

Just before a barn at the bottom turn left through a metal fieldgate in the fence on the left and go straight across a field.

Go through two wooden kissing gates at the far side and on, down a concrete drive. Follow it left, at houses on the right, onto a road with a green space ahead.

Turn immediately right down a road called Abbots Walk. At the bottom turn right again onto Churchfield Way.

When this meets a main road, turn right to immediately reach the Tickled Trout pub with Great Stour River and railway station just beyond. This is the end of the section into Wye.

Section 9 Return

Wye to Hastingleigh

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn & Wye

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: Car park at the Tickled Trout for customers, plus some parking by the village hall a short distance back on the right off the main road.

Comment: A generally straightforward walk back to the start with a literarily dead straight walk for over two miles to start. Then a steep climb up onto the North Downs on a pleasant sheltered path. A short section of NDW leads to Cold Blow Farm then easy going back into Hastingleigh.

From the Tickled Trout pub, turn left up the main road towards the centre of Wye. Keep straight up this road, Bridge Street, for 200 metres ignoring roads off left and right.

At the very top, where the street bears left (towards a pub), bear right up Cherry Garden Lane.

Keep straight up the lane and forward onto an enclosed     path beyond houses.

At the end meet an road and continue on up it. Where the road bends right go straight on up a gravel path.

Reach and cross a road and continue on an enclosed, grassy path (there is a farm over on your right).

Eventually, at the top of the field, do a slight dog leg left and right, then continue forward up the side of the field ahead with a hedge on your right (ignore a cross path).

Emerge through a hedge onto a road and turn right a short way to a junction.

Turn left up the side road. Ignore a footpath off immediately right and continue uphill. Ignore a second path off right.

At the top of the hill. Turn left over metal barrier onto a sunken path and go steeply uphill.

Keep on for ¼ mile to a metal kissing gate by a wooden fieldgate. Through this reach a junction with the North Downs Way. Turn right along it.

Go through a large metal kissing gate and on along an enclosed path (possibly accompanied by vociferous dogs the other side of the fence).

Turn right past the end through another metal kissing gate and continue along a wide grassy path with a hedge on your left.

Go through a further metal kissing gate and keep on to reach double wooden fieldgates into the yard of Cold Blow Farm.

Turn left up the yard, past barns, to a metal equine fieldgate onto the entrance drive. Go up this passing Staple Farm to reach a road junction at Folly Town.

Turn right on the road for 100 metres to reach a crossroads. Go straight over looking for a footpath immediately off into the field on your right.

Follow the field edge with a fence on your left and the road the other side. Look out for some road signs on the left. At this point the path should go diagonally right across the corner of the field. Locals seems to stick to the field edge.

In which case keep forward to the corner then up the other side of the field to meet a narrow belt of trees. Look for a path through, to a metal kissing gate at the far side.

Through this go forward along the edge of the field with a hedge on your left. At the far side go through a metal kissing gate in the hedge and down steps to a road.

Turn left for 100 metres to emerge at a crossroads and seats by the village pond in Hastingleigh and start of the section. The pub is along the road on the left but is only open Thursday to Sunday evening.
