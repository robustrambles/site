subtitle: Herne Bay to Herne Common
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet'
  Total Circular Distance: '4 miles/3 hours'
  Start: From Herne Bay Railway Station main entrance. The station has a car park and it saves time and effort to pay for a day’s parking.
  Comment: >
    Lots of new building south of the station but the paths are all there. It helps to have the OS app on your mobile phone. Beyond Herne village the paths are rough across pasture and the main bridlepath is muddy in places. The Curious Cat at Herne Common is open seven days a week.

From the front of Herne Bay Station, turn right down the Approach Road. Look for a tarmac path going off right and follow it down and under the railway lines. Continue on an enclosed path to a road. Cross and continue up the path opposite.

Soon reach another, busier, road. Cross, slightly left, to Flamingo Drive and go up here.

Pass a pond on the right and, at the end of the road, by Harlequin Close, go forward on a narrow tarmac path between bushes.

Emerge into a close and turn immediately left on a gravel path. Soon cross an unusual metal stile and go on through new building.

Come to a new road. Cross straight over to continue on a tarmac path. Reach the end of a close. Bear right on the road, past a pond on your right.

Stay on the road for some way as it curves left round a playing field on your left. Pass Holness Road on your right then turn right along a gravel footpath between ponds.

Go up and under a bypass, then on across a field (looking ripe for development).    

Emerge onto a road and turn right. Soon merge into a second road and keep forward for 100 metres.  

Opposite open country on your right, turn left on a narrow path into woods. Reach and go through an equestrian gate and continue forward (ignore path off, back right).

Reach a further equestrian gate into a field. Go through then diagonally right, uphill, past a fenced off conifer tree to a stile in the top fence. DO NOT CROSS but turn right along with the fence on your left.

When the fence ends keep on in the same direction across the open field to a stile by a metal fieldgate. Go forward on a track along the edge of paddocks for some way.

At the end go through a metal fieldgate. In a few paces beyond go left up a muddy bridleway for some distance.

At the top of the hill reach a metal equestrian gate and go through. Immediately turn left with trees on your left and new housing on your right.

At Swallow Court join a road and keep forward all the way to a main road ahead.

Cross with care, slightly left, to the Curious Cat pub and the end of the section.
