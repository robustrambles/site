  Map: 'Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye'
  'Total Circular Distance': '8 miles/4 hours'
  Start: 'Parking around the village green at Boughton Lees'
  Comment: 'A pleasant and varied walk back to Wye with good views and a church to visit at Boughton Aluph. The A28 crossing requires special care and a short section of narrow grass verge. Across the low-lying fields beyond a sharp kink left, along a field edge, is required before a turn back right. Don’t be tempted to try a short cut.'

This walk was completed on Sunday, 20th. August 2023 by Colin & Rosemary Bridge with their good friends Stephen & Eng Scoffham with mutual enjoyment of the varied countryside and environment.

With the Flying Horse pub behind, turn left down the road to the bottom corner. Keep on along the road for a short distance, leaving the green behind.

In a few paces turn left, up a side road on The Pilgrims Way and the North Downs Way for ¼ mile.

Eventually as the road begins to rise, pass a footpath off right then a byway on a vehicle driveway off left.

As the road begins to bear right, turn left, up into a path enclosed between fences; still on the NDW.

Emerge into a field and continue up the side. At the top turn right through bushes, and then immediately left, still in the NDW.

Pass the church at Boughton Aluph on your left (well worth a visit and often open), and reach a roadway. Cross to the (currently) broken stile opposite.

Over this go forward up a pasture to double wooden fieldgates. Keep straight on across a field with excellent views.

At the far side, just before the top corner, bear right into bushes and follow an enclosed path around to a road.

Cross this and keep forward, downhill, on a gravel track towards a farm.

Pass through the farm buildings. Beyond, go through a wooden swing gate by a metal fieldgate.

Immediately turn right, up the bank into a field corner (no waymark here). Go down the field edge with a hedge on your right.

In the bottom corner drop steeply down through bushes and a wooden swing gate, into the field below.

Keep on down the edge with a hedge on your right. Reach a busy main road. Cross with care and turn left along a narrow verge for 10 metres. Reach a footpath off right and cross a stile in the hedge.

Enter a field and go straight across the centre.

Cross a footbridge in the hedge ahead and bear right across the corner of the next field to a footbridge.

Cross and turn left along the side of a ditch on your left.

At the bottom corner turn left (it feels away from the general direction of the walk, but it is correct) across the field to the hedge ahead. DO NOT CONTINUE THROUGH THE HEDGE but turn sharp right, back across the bottom of the field.

Reach a hedge. Go through and on across a field to a footbridge over a brook. Continue on a feint, overgrown path towards a railway.

Cross this with care (used by high speed trains) and then the river bridge beyond.

Now bear right, aiming for the conspicuous tower of Wye church. In the corner go through a metal fieldgate and cross a concrete farm bridge. Bear right up towards a barn.

Continue past the barn on a driveway looking for a metal fieldgate into the field on your right. Through this go straight across the field.

Pass through two wooden kissing gates at the far side and on, down a concrete drive. Follow it around to the left, by houses on the right, onto a road, with a green space ahead.

Turn immediately right down a road called Abbots Walk. At the bottom turn right again down Churchfield Way.

Where this meets a main road, turn right to immediately reach the Tickled Trout pub with the Great Stour River and railway station just beyond and the start of the section.
