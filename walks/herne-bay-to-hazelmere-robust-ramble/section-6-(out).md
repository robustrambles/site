title: Section 6 (Out)
subtitle: Bekesbourne to Kingston
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet'
  'Total Circular Distance': '8 miles/4 hours'
  Start: 'From the Chalkpit Farm Shop in Bekesbourne, parking here if intending to be a customer.'
  Comment: 'A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and excellent downland views, with hills and hollows, woodland and fields. Most of the walk is on farm drives and tracks. There are short linking sections of road walking where care is needed as verges are sparse. The North Downs Way alongside the A2 dual carriageway is noisy but the Black Robin pub in Kingston is some solace.'

Leave Chalkpit Farm Shop complex and regain the public road. Turn left with care, and immediately past buildings on your left (and before oasts), turn left into an enclosed path between hedges.

Soon go through a wooden swing gate, then on, up the side of a field with a fence on your left.

After some way reach a road. Turn left for 75 metres, passing Keepers Cottage on the right. Turn right into the entrance, then on, along an enclosed path.

Keep along the edge of woods for ¼ mile. At a cross path, turn left into the corner of orchards. Continue straight ahead, with a tall hedge on your left.

Keep going for ½ mile with a tall hedge on your right and orchards on the left. Eventually drop downhill and turn right on an old tarmac drive towards the buildings of Highland Court Farm (the path is signed as a bridleway).

At a T-junction turn left by a car park, then next right up the exit drive. Keep up this drive past an industrial estate. On reaching a T-junction, go straight over and on up the side of an orchard.

Swing slightly right with the grassy track. At the top go through a gap in the hedge to a T-junction with the North Downs Way.

Turn left for a mile. Soon cross a road and continue up a large open field. Eventually cross another road and continue through a gate in the hedge ahead. Continue up another meadow.

100 metres before a hedge at the far side turn right on a feint cross path down the corner of the field. At the bottom meet the hedge and go through a metal gate and down to a road (Ileden Lane), a dual carriageway is down on the right.

Cross the lane to a tarmac bridlepath and follow this along by the busy A2 road for ¼ mile.

Eventually reach a footbridge on your right and cross the main road. Turn right at the far side down to a road. Turn left down this to a junction at the bottom. Cross over to the Black Robin pub in Kingston and the end of the section.
