subtitle: Wye to Hastingleigh
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn & Wye'
  'Total Circular Distance': '8 miles/4 hours'
  Start: 'Car park at the Tickled Trout for customers, plus some parking by the village hall a short distance back on the right off the main road.'
  Comment: 'A generally straightforward walk back to the start with a literarily dead straight walk for over two miles to start. Then a steep climb up onto the North Downs on a pleasant sheltered path. A short section of NDW leads to Cold Blow Farm then easy going back into Hastingleigh.'

From the Tickled Trout pub, turn left up the main road towards the centre of Wye. Keep straight up this road, Bridge Street, for 200 metres ignoring roads off left and right.

At the very top, where the street bears left (towards a pub), bear right up Cherry Garden Lane.

Keep straight up the lane and forward onto an enclosed path beyond houses.

At the end meet an road and continue on up it. Where the road bends right go straight on up a gravel path.

Reach and cross a road and continue on an enclosed, grassy path (there is a farm over on your right).

Eventually, at the top of the field, do a slight dog leg left and right, then continue forward up the side of the field ahead with a hedge on your right (ignore a cross path).

Emerge through a hedge onto a road and turn right a short way to a junction.

Turn left up the side road. Ignore a footpath off immediately right and continue uphill. Ignore a second path off right.

At the top of the hill. Turn left over metal barrier onto a sunken path and go steeply uphill.

Keep on for Â¼ mile to a metal kissing gate by a wooden fieldgate. Through this reach a junction with the North Downs Way. Turn right along it.

Go through a large metal kissing gate and on along an enclosed path (possibly accompanied by vociferous dogs the other side of the fence).

Turn right past the end through another metal kissing gate and continue along a wide grassy path with a hedge on your left.

Go through a further metal kissing gate and keep on to reach double wooden fieldgates into the yard of Cold Blow Farm.

Turn left up the yard, past barns, to a metal equine fieldgate onto the entrance drive. Go up this passing Staple Farm to reach a road junction at Folly Town.

Turn right on the road for 100 metres to reach a crossroads. Go straight over looking for a footpath immediately off into the field on your right.

Follow the field edge with a fence on your left and the road the other side. Look out for some road signs on the left. At this point the path should go diagonally right across the corner of the field. Locals seems to stick to the field edge.

In which case keep forward to the corner then up the other side of the field to meet a narrow belt of trees. Look for a path through, to a metal kissing gate at the far side.

Through this go forward along the edge of the field with a hedge on your left. At the far side go through a metal kissing gate in the hedge and down steps to a road.

Turn left for 100 metres to emerge at a crossroads and seats by the village pond in Hastingleigh and start of the section. The pub is along the road on the left but is only open Thursday to Sunday evening.
