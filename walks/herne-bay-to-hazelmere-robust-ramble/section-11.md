Robust Ramble

Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 11 Out

Boughton Lees to Challock

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: Parking around the village green at Boughton Lees

Comment: A varied walk with fields and parkland. Basically climbing all the way to Challock, steady but no extreme slopes. The church at Challock unfortunately is locked with the key available from The Barn Farm shop over a mile away and ahead. The Flying Horse pub at Brabourne Lees is closed on Mondays but the Stag at Challock is open every day. This section is quite short but the return is considerably longer.

With the Flying Horse behind, walk across the centre of the cricket pitch and green to the war memorial cross and on to the end of grass at a road junction.

Carefully bear right to cross the main road to the church opposite. Turn left past the church and then immediately right, up the bank through the hedge to a broken wooden kissing gate.

Go forward across the grass, away from the road, on the North Downs Way. Exit onto an hotel drive. Cross diagonally right, and continue up a rising pasture. At the top turn right with a wire fence on your left.

On approaching an elevated water tank, meet a cross path. Turn right down this. At the bottom emerge onto an estate road and cross to a metal kissing gate. Bear slightly diagonally right up a rising field, aiming towards the edge of trees at the very top.

Meet a farm track at the top of the field and go forward still uphill. Continue to the top of the hill skirting woods on your left.

At the very top, by a stone seat, Challock Church appears in the valley below. A path should run down the field to the church from here, but you must go on down 20 metres to find the waymark pointing towards the church (stay on the farm track if the filed is not walkable).

Enter the churchyard and turn left, past the church, to the car park. Exit down to the end of a rough country road and turn right, past the manor house.

Keep on the road steeply uphill. At the top pass a school on your right. Reach an area of grass on the right with a war memorial cross. Turn right on the road here. Follow it all the way past the village hall and cricket pitch to emerge onto a main road. Cross and trun left a short distance to The Stag pub at Challock roundabout.

Section 11 Return

Challock to Boughton Lees

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: Parking at the Village Hall or the pub.

Comment: This return is a much longer section than the outward. It includes a long forest walk then a gradual descent with splendid views down to Boughton Lees. Allow plenty of time.

With The Stag pub on your left and the roundabout behind, go down the main road, away from the roundabout, for 100 metres.

Just past the current last house on your left, turn left into a footpath enclosed between wooden fence and hedge.

When the enclosed path ends, keep straight on along the edge of a wood. Finally enter the main wood.

Soon exit up onto a gravel drive (ignore track down left). Go on as before along the gravel drive.

At a sharp righthand bend, g straight on, on a path into woods (ignore paths off right and left).

Eventually pass the buildings of Oathill Farm on your right. Cross the entrance drive and continue on a footpath.

Go through a pedestrian gate to a junction of ways. Ignore two tracks off to the left and go forward, steeply uphill, on a narrow gravel footpath.

Continue forward for ½ mile ignoring all cross paths. Go steeply down then up.

Eventually reach a wide gravel forest track . Go straight ahead on it.

At a T-junction turn right a few paces, then left at a waymarked path into trees.

Cross a wide forest track and again go forward into trees.

Enter an open field and cross, slightly diagonally left to a metal kissing gate into woods at the far side. Keep on down to a road.

Cross the road to a path into bushes. Soon reach a metal kissing gate and emerge at the top of a field (excellent views here). Turn left along the field edge.

In 30 metres reach a corner by a metal kissing gate. Here turn right, steeply downhill, to a farm in the valley below.

Go through the buildings and steeply up the drive beyond. Eventually approach the exit onto a busy main road.

Just before the main road turn left along the top of a field with a hedge on your right, to a wooden gate into trees (this is not a PROW).

Through the gate, turn left downhill on an enclosed path (this is a PROW).

Near the bottom, ignore a footpath off left, and go forward to a drive and junction of ways. Turn sharp right on a drive going uphill.

Near the top, just before a white house, turn off left into a narrow path into woods. In 20 metres go sharp left along a path between wire fences.

Reach and cross two stiles into the top of a large sloping field. Go straight down.

At the bottom hedge turn right and follow an easy path for some way to reach a road. Turn right on this road for some way. Eventually reach a T-junction in Boughton Lees.

Turn right a short distance to reach the village green and the Flying Horse pub at the start of the section.
