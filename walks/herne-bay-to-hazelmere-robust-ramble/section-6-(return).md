With the Black Robin behind, turn right to a road junction, then bear right, up Covet Lane. In a few paces turn right again into Church Lane.

Past the first house on the left, turn left towards a metal fieldgate then bear right to a metal kissing gate into a pasture.

Go diagonally right across the field to a wooden swing gate hidden in trees. Go through this to a second wooden gate and then up an enclosed path between fences.

Emerge onto a drive and turn right down to a road. Turn left on the road past the church. Reach a T-junction at the bottom and turn left.

In 20 metres, opposite house number 19, turn right onto a bridleway. Keep on this for ¾ mile.

Along the way pass through two equestrian gates, then on along a grassy track.

Exit onto a drive. Join this to continue in the same direction as before. Eventually emerge onto a road in Bishopsbourne and keep forward through the village past The Mermaid pub on the left. At a T-junction in front of the church, turn right.

At the next junction, turn left past a rustic lodge and immediately right up an enclosed path for ¼ mile. Excellent views to the left.

Exit at the top through a metal kissing gate and go immediately right up to a road.

Cross to Higham Lane opposite. Walk up this to the top. Here turn right on a Bridleway. At the end, turn left over a bridge. Immediately over this turn sharp left on a path running alongside a motorway down on your left.

Near the end, ignore a footpath off right and keep forward. Follow the path as it finally bears right, away from the motorway, into a field corner. Continue diagonally right down the top edge of the field.

Drop steeply down to a corner of woods. Ignore a footpath off left down to a road and, instead, turn right keeping along the edge of the wood with a field on your left. At the next corner with a junction of paths, turn diagonally right uphill.

Emerge on a road at the far side and turn right for 30 metres. Reach a path off up steps in the bank on the left, to a field corner.

Go on along the field edge then continue up the open field. Eventually drop down by farm buildings on the right to go through a gate into an enclosed path out to a road.

Turn right a few paces then right into the entrance of the Chalkpit Farm shop and the start of the section.
