title: Section 5 (Out)
subtitle: Littlebourne to Bekesbourne
details:
  Map: 'Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet'
  'Total Circular Distance': '5 miles/2.5 hours'
  Start: 'From the Evenhill pub in Littlebourne, parking if intending to take refreshment here.'
  Comment: 'A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and views, with hills and hollows, woodland and fields; a couple of stiles. Most of the walk is on farm drives and tracks. There are short linking sections of road walking where care is needed as verges are sparse. Sadly the pub at Bekesbourne has closed but the section finishes at a country shopping outlet with café so refreshment is on offer.'

With the Evenhill pub behind, turn left down the main road for ½ mile. It’s not unpleasant and there are some interesting buildings.

At the bottom of the hill pass playing fields on your left and reach a pedestrian crossing. Cross to the righthandside and continue down with care as the pavement narrows.

Reach Bekesbourne Lane at a crossroads. Turn right along the lane and with care cross to a grassy area on your left. Go up to the end and rejoin the road (no verge) for 30 metres to a sharp right bend in the road.

Here turn left over a cattle grid onto a metalled drive (ignore the footpath going straight ahead). Keep on the drive through interesting low-lying countryside for ½ mile.

At isolated houses on the right, stay on the drive as it turns left uphill, and in a short distance, at a farm, turn right, past oasts (on your left), to continue, still on the drive.

Keep forward past more farm buildings then on past trees on a slightly rougher track. Reach the end of the drive at a parking area by a cottage down on your right.

Here continue straight ahead, through a metal fieldgate into a field and on, on a grassy track to a second metal fieldgate at the far side.

Bear left across the next pasture towards a distant house. Leave the field through a metal fieldgate and cross a railway bridge.

Keep on through houses (this is the site of the former wartime aerodrome), to a junction. Turn right down Aerodrome Road to a T-junction.

Turn right down a road to a farm site (formerly a hop farm) at the bottom of the hill. This Chalkpit Farm Shop with café and the end of the section.
