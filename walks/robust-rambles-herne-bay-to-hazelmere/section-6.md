Robust Ramble Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 6 Out

Bekesbourne to Kingston

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: From the Chalkpit Farm Shop in Bekesbourne, parking here if intending to be a customer.

Comment: A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and excellent downland views, with hills and hollows, woodland and fields. Most of the walk is on farm drives and tracks. There are short linking sections of road walking where care is needed as verges are sparse. The North Downs Way alongside the A2 dual carriageway is noisy but the Black Robin pub in Kingston is some solace.

Leave Chalkpit Farm Shop complex and regain the public road. Turn left with care, and immediately past buildings on your left (and before oasts), turn left into an enclosed path between hedges.

Soon go through a wooden swing gate, then on, up the side of a field with a fence on your left.

After some way reach a road. Turn left for 75 metres, passing Keepers Cottage on the right. Turn right into the entrance, then on, along an enclosed path.

Keep along the edge of woods for ¼ mile. At a cross path, turn left into the corner of orchards. Continue straight ahead, with a tall hedge on your left.

Keep going for ½ mile with a tall hedge on your right and orchards on the left. Eventually drop downhill and turn right on an old tarmac drive towards the buildings of Highland Court Farm (the path is signed as a bridleway).

At a T-junction turn left by a car park, then next right up the exit drive. Keep up this drive past an industrial estate. On reaching a T-junction, go straight over and on up the side of an orchard.

Swing slightly right with the grassy track. At the top go through a gap in the hedge to a T-junction with the North Downs Way.

Turn left for a mile. Soon cross a road and continue up a large open field. Eventually cross another road and continue through a gate in the hedge ahead. Continue up another meadow.

100 metres before a hedge at the far side turn right on a feint cross path down the corner of the field. At the bottom meet the hedge and go through a metal gate and down to a road (Ileden Lane), a dual carriageway is down on the right.

Cross the lane to a tarmac bridlepath and follow this along by the busy A2 road for ¼ mile.

Eventually reach a footbridge on your right and cross the main road. Turn right at the far side down to a road. Turn left down this to a junction at the bottom. Cross over to the Black Robin pub in Kingston and the end of the section.

Kingston to Bekesbourne

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: From the Black Robin pub in Kingston, parking if intending to take refreshment here.

Comment: A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and downland views, with hills and hollows, woodland and fields.

With the Black Robin behind, turn right to a road junction, then bear right, up Covet Lane. In a few paces turn right again into Church Lane.

Past the first house on the left, turn left towards a metal fieldgate then bear right to a metal kissing gate into a pasture.

Go diagonally right across the field to a wooden swing gate hidden in trees. Go through this to a second wooden gate and then up an enclosed path between fences.

Emerge onto a drive and turn right down to a road. Turn left on the road past the church. Reach a T-junction at the bottom and turn left.

In 20 metres, opposite house number 19, turn right onto a bridleway. Keep on this for ¾ mile.

Along the way pass through two equestrian gates, then on along a grassy track.

Exit onto a drive. Join this to continue in the same direction as before. Eventually emerge onto a road in Bishopsbourne and keep forward through the village past The Mermaid pub on the left. At a T-junction in front of the church, turn right.

At the next junction, turn left past a rustic lodge and immediately right up an enclosed path for ¼ mile. Excellent views to the left.

Exit at the top through a metal kissing gate and go immediately right up to a road.

Cross to Higham Lane opposite. Walk up this to the top. Here turn right on a Bridleway. At the end, turn left over a bridge. Immediately over this turn sharp left on a path running alongside a motorway down on your left.

Near the end, ignore a footpath off right and keep forward. Follow the path as it finally bears right, away from the motorway, into a field corner. Continue diagonally right down the top edge of the field.

Drop steeply down to a corner of woods. Ignore a footpath off left down to a road and, instead, turn right keeping along the edge of the wood with a field on your left. At the next corner with a junction of paths, turn diagonally right uphill.

Emerge on a road at the far side and turn right for 30 metres. Reach a path off up steps in the bank on the left, to a field corner.

Go on along the field edge then continue up the open field. Eventually drop down by farm buildings on the right to go through a gate into an enclosed path out to a road.

Turn right a few paces then right into the entrance of the Chalkpit Farm shop and the start of the section.
