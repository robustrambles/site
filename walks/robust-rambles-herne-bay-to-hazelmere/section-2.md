Robust Ramble Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 2  Out

Herne Common to Calcott, The Punch Tavern

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 4 miles/3 hours

Start: From the Curious Cat pub, parking by arrangement only

Comment: A short walk with some excellent countryside. The paths are mostly clear but there are stretches which become very muddy in wet weather. A section across a field to the Wealden Forest Park is marked in the wrong place so follow the instructions carefully. There are a couple of stiles. The A291, Herne Bay to Canterbury road is fast and busy and only occasional sections of pavement.

From the Curious Cat pub turn left along the main road a short distance. In 30 metres, go down the footpath on the left, immediately before a Cattery.

Emerge onto a country road at the bottom and turn right along it for ¼ mile. Just past the last house on your left, Bramble Lodge, turn left on a path by double metal fieldgates. Go forward into an enclosed path.

Soon enter a field and follow the top edge with a hedge on your right.

Keep on this field edge track, down and around, to the very bottom corner at a gap between woods.

Go forward on a narrower path up the side of the field ahead with the wood on your right.

At the top corner is a junction of several paths. Currently there is a waymark post here and an arrow indicates the way diagonally right across the huge field ahead. Unfortunately the path has been wrongly reinstated across the crop. It should go from here but actually goes off 200 metres further along the field edge.

So, turn sharp right along the path parallel with the woods on your right. In 20 metres a path goes off left uphill cross the field to bushes on the brow of the hill, IGNORE THIS PATH. Keep forward parallel to the trees on right for 200 metres.

Where the wood juts out again to meet the path, look for a narrow, feint path off diagonally left, across the field towards distant warehouses. Follow this down to the far opposite corner and emerge on a busy main road at bus stops. The Wealden Forest Park is opposite.

Cross with care and turn left along verge, passing the entrance to the Wealdon Forest Park car park (café and camping shop here). Keep along past business units then finally, past Oaklands bungalow. Keep on the verge until it turns right to a footpath going into the wood.

Soon reach a metal kissing gate. Go forward and slightly right  on a clearly defined path signed with purple waymarks. Follow this for ¼ mile to reach a metal fieldgate on the left with a main road beyond. Go forward a few more paces to a metal kissing gate and through this to a main road.

Turn right along the pavement for 100 metres to reach the Punch Tavern on the left across the road and the end of the section.

Total Circular Distance: 4 miles/3 hours

Start: From The Punch Tavern, extensive parking here if intending make use of the facilities.

Comment: Thankfully a pleasant walk back away from roads and traffic. A couple of stiles and the odd patch of mud.

From the Punch Tavern, cross the main road with care and turn right on the pavement. In 80 metres, by a bungalow, turn right, to cross the road again and go into Woodlands Farm entrance.

Where the drive swings right, at the entrance to Bird’s Nest, bear left on a stoney farm track, circling past the farm over on your right, then forward for ½ mile along a field edge with a solar farm on your right.

At the bottom corner, bear left across scrub, to a footbridge and cross to a metal gate into a field. Turn left up the edge with a hedge on your left.

At a corner, cross a footbridge and turn right up the field edge with a hedge on your right. Emerge through a gate and footbridge onto a road. Cross and continue on a narrow path through trees and bushes.

Emerge from these and continue across an open field. At a corner of woods ahead, ignore a cross path and continue forward, along the side of a field with the woods on your right.

At a corner and junction of paths, turn right, into the woods, then almost immediately left. Keep on steadily down through the wood to eventually reach a footbridge.

Cross and turn left along the edge of the wood, now on your left, along an enclosed muddy path.

In 50 metres, turn left, over a footbridge in the hedge, into a field. Turn right up the edge with a hedge on your right.

At the top, cross a stile into an enclosed and muddy path, around the foot of gardens. Cross a footbridge then a stile to a road.

Go straight over and up the footpath opposite to reach a main road. Turn right a short distance to reach the Curious Cat pub and start of the section.
