Robust Ramble Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 5 Out

Littlebourne to Bekesbourne

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 5 miles/2.5 hours

Start: From the Evenhill pub in Littlebourne, parking if intending to take refreshment here.

Comment: A mixed walk with a great variety of country paths and views, with hills and hollows, woodland and fields; a couple of stiles. Most of the walk is on farm drives and tracks. There are short linking sections of road walking where care is needed as verges are sparse. Sadly the pub at Bekesbourne has closed but the section finishes at a country shopping outlet with café so refreshment is on offer.

With the Evenhill pub behind, turn left down the main road for ½ mile. It’s not unpleasant and there are some interesting buildings.

At the bottom of the hill pass playing fields on your left and reach a pedestrian crossing. Cross to the righthandside and continue down with care as the pavement narrows.

Reach Bekesbourne Lane at a crossroads. Turn right along the lane and with care cross to a grassy area on your left. Go up to the end and rejoin the road (no verge) for 30 metres to a sharp right bend in the road.

Here turn left over a cattle grid onto a metalled drive (ignore the footpath going straight ahead). Keep on the drive through interesting low-lying countryside for ½ mile.

At isolated houses on the right, stay on the drive as it turns left uphill, and in a short distance, at a farm, turn right, past oasts (on your left), to continue, still on the drive.

Keep forward past more farm buildings then on past trees on a slightly rougher track. Reach the end of the drive at a parking area by a cottage down on your right.

Here continue straight ahead, through a metal fieldgate into a field and on, on a grassy track to a second metal fieldgate at the far side.

Bear left across the next pasture towards a distant house. Leave the field through a metal fieldgate and cross a railway bridge.

Keep on through houses (this is the site of the former wartime aerodrome), to a junction. Turn right down Aerodrome Road to a T-junction.

Turn right down a road to a farm site (formerly a hop farm) at the bottom of the hill. This Chalkpit Farm Shop with café and the end of the section.

Section 5 Return

Bekesbourne to Littlebourne

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 4 miles/2 hours

Start: From the Chalkpit Farm Shop with parking for patrons

Comment: A mixed walk with a variety of country paths and views, with hills and hollows, orchards and fields. Most of the walk is on farm drives and tracks. Bekesbourne Church is in a splendid setting.

Leave Chalkpit Farm shop complex to reach the public road. Turn left with care along the grassy verge.

In 50 metres reach a wood on your left. Look for a path up into the wood and turn immediately right along the edge of the wood with the road down on your right.

At the end of the wood, turn left on a public footpath with a fence on your right. Bear right down past the church then through the lychgate and down to a narrow road.

Cross the road and then a footbridge. Bear right to a metal kissing gate into the field opposite.

Go diagonally right across the centre of the field to a stile in the far opposite corner out to a road. Turn left down to a T-junction with a main road.

Cross and turn right under a railway bridge. Join a footpath turning left up the side of the railway.

Pass the station at the top and bear right, still on a footpath. Keep in a direct line past a car park, then on, on an enclosed path to a road.

Turn left up the road for 50 metres. Just past a farm entrance on your right, turn right on a gravel track.

At the end bear right to a concealed path dropping down through bushes, then on, up a path lined by splendid beech trees.

Emerge into the corner of a field of poly tunnels. Go up the side with a hedge on your right.

Where the hedge ends (just before the top of the field), turn left on a cross path down between poly tunnels.

At the bottom, keep on beyond the polytunnels to a hidden stile in the very bottom corner. Cross and keep forward across a meadow.

At the far side go through a wooden equestrian gate and turn sharp right into a farmyard, then straight on past the farm office.

On reaching the Kent Pip cider barn straight ahead (sometimes open for refreshment), follow the farm track around to the left then up and around to the right.

Keep on this farm road for ½ mile past orchards and cottages half way.

At the very end reach a main road. Turn right a few paces and cross with care to turn left into woods past a rusty fieldgate.

In 100 metres turn right on a cross path and follow through to the edge of the wood at the far side. Turn right out to a main road.

Turn left on the pavement down the roadside and soon reach the Evenhill pub in Littlebourne and the start of the section.
