Robust Ramble Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 3 Out

Calcott, The Punch Tavern to Fordwich

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 5 miles/3 hours

Start: From The Punch Tavern, parking if intending to take refreshment here

Comment: A mixed walk with some excellent country paths and views but also an urban section through Sturry. Unfortunately due to a permanently waterlogged and extremely muddy path the only alternative is ¼  mile of road walking at the start. This is along the A291, Herne Bay to Canterbury road which is fast and busy. There is a pavement, but go in single file taking constant care.

From The Punch Tavern, cross the main road and turn left along the pavement. Pass new housing and an older white house at Calcott on your right, and keep on down the pavement for ¼ mile.

Pass several business units as you go. The pavement deteriorates near the bottom at brick bridge abutments. Carefully cross to the other side and keep on along a rougher pathway to the very bottom of the hill.

Just past a bus stop on the other side, cross to a wide concrete farm entrance drive and double metal fieldgates. Go up the drive between fields.

At the end, exit through a metal fieldgate and turn left up a rough country lane, uphill all the way between fields and orchards. Begin to pass houses then emerge onto a main road.

Cross slightly left to a footpath opposite. Continue along and keep forward where the path merges into an access drive. Reach a main road and turn left for some way.

Where the road bends right, go left onto a footpath down through woods. Ignore a footpath off right and keep on downhill for ¼ mile.

At a Y-fork by a field on the right, bear left and at the next junction keep left again. Cross open ground, straight down to a railway line by Junior Kings School. Cross the railway through ancient iron kissing gates and go down the approach road.

Turn left at a junction along into Sturry village now rather a sorry place with closed shops and pub. Go forward to a main road by a level crossing.

Turn right along the main road to a pedestrian crossing. Turn off the main road which is bending right and go up a side road straight ahead called Fordwich Road passing Water Lane over on your right.

As you head towards Fordwich look out for a footpath off left between a house and a bungalow. This is used on the return journey. Continue up and over a narrow bridge to reach the George and Dragon on your left and the end of the section.

Section 3 Return

Fordwich to Calcott, The Punch Tavern

OS Map: Explorer 150 Canterbury & the Isle of Thanet

Total Circular Distance: 5 miles/3 hours

Start: From The George & Dragon pub, parking opposite

Comment: A mixed walk with some excellent country paths and views but also an urban section through Sturry. Several stiles, inevitably some missing the cross steps.

From the George & Dragon walk back towards the main road in Sturry. Ignore the footpath off right immediately over the river bridge. Keep back down until in sight of the main road junction. Turn right along the footpath noticed on the outward route, going off between a bungalow and a house.

Soon ignore a footpath off left and keep forward into scrub. Emerge at a concrete access road. Ignore this access road and turn immediately left, upto a metal fieldgate and on up the side of a playing field.

At top corner turn right to continue along the top edge. Keep on by a miniature railway track on your right, looking out for a gap in the hedge on your left leading to a crossing of the main line railway.

Join an enclosed path, then, in a few paces, left, up another enclosed path to a main road in Sturry.

Cross with care and turn left. Take the first road off right uphill. Look out for Delaware Close going off left and turn into this.

At the end of the close bear right to a footpath going up into a garage area. Join the access road, left, to a junction. Turn left for 10 metres, then right, up a footpath through trees.

Reach a road. Cross to the footpath opposite and continue up. This becomes a road. Follow it all the way round to a T-junction. Turn right, then first left into Hillbrow Avenue, to reach another T-junction.

Turn right for 150 metres.

There is a field on your left. Look for a stile on the left into the corner of this field. Go up the edge of the field with a fence on your right.

Enter woodland to soon reach a wooden kissing gate. Go diagonally right, down the meadow to enter woods at the bottom.

Leave the wood over a footbridge. Turn right along                        the field edge with the woods on your right. Where the trees stop, turn left, down and across the field, under power lines.

At the bottom, cross a broken stile and go forward to a footbridge.

Over this turn sharply diagonally right on a feint path up and across the bottom section of the field.

Reach and cross a stile in the fence ahead and continue straight over the next field.

At the far side, turn left up the edge. At the top corner turn right on a farm track. In 100 metres, look for a stile in the fence on the left.

Cross and turn sharply diagonally left across the field.

At the far side cross a footbridge and stile in bushes. Continue slightly right across the next field.

Cross a stile at the far side and continue, again slightly right, across a large field.

At the far side bear right to a gap in the hedge ahead (ignore a path going left into thick bushes).

Go through gap to a sloping field and bear diagonally right downhill to a gap in the bottom hedge. Go through and straight up the field beyond towards a white house.

Go through bushes at the top to emerge onto the main road at Calcott. Cross with care and turn right along the pavement to soon reach The Punch Tavern and start of the section.
