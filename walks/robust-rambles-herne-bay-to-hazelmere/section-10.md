Robust Ramble

Herne Bay to Hazlemere

Section 10 Out

Wye to Boughton Lees

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: Park at the Tickled Trout if intending to visit, otherwise there is a car park at the Village Hall and recreation ground a little way up Bridge Street, by the side of the school, be aware that this is a section of one-way street.

Comment: A mixed walk with a variety of country paths and excellent views in very quiet country. The outward section is mostly across arable fields and generally flat, there are several footbridges. Be careful crossing the A28 and notice the slight deviation, right, to the farm access. There is a railway crossing and a river crossing.

From the Tickled Trout pub turn left, uphill on Bridge Street, the road going directly up into Wye. This is a one-way street.

Immediately past the Village Hall, turn right up the car park entrance. Keep to the left edge, past a school entrance on the left and a recreation ground on your right.

At the end pf the tarmac roadway, bear left through a wooden swing gate, then immediately right, up through trees passing another playing field on your left.

In the top corner go through a wooden kissing gate and non, through scrub.

Reach a field and continue straight ahead.

Cross a footbridge into the next field and keep on.

Leave the field as you pass a pond on your right and bear right across the corner of the field ahead.

Cross another footbridge and keep on, across the field to a long, ageing footbridge over the Great Stour River.

Over this, go straight up the field to a fence along the railway at the top side. The path should actually bear left in mid-field and go diagonally left up to the top left corner. However, it is easier to go straight up to the railway fence, then turn left 100 metres along to the corner.

Here find a railway crossing. At the other side turn immediately left on a grassy way along by the railway on your left.

At the end of the fence on your right, turn right, up to another footbridge into the corner of a field.

Now turn diagonally left, across the centre of the field to a post by a bush at the far side.

On reaching the post, turn right up to a main road. Cross with care as the traffic is fast. Bear right a few paces to a farm entrance at Wilmington Farm.

Go up past farm buildings to continue up the edge of a field. Just past the last of the farm buildings on your right, reach a cross path.

Turn right to cross the field on your right towards a farm and an oast.

Exit the field onto a driveway. Turn left on this a short distance. Just before the oast, turn diagonally right, uphill, across the open field.

At the far opposite corner go through bushes and on across the field beyond.

Go through the far hedge and on, in the same direction, with a wire fence on your right, to a metal fieldgate ahead.

Beyond this gate soon emerge onto the village green at Boughton Lees and cross to the Flying Horse pub opposite.

Section 10 Return

Boughton Lees to Wye

OS Map: Explorer 137 Ashford, Headcorn and Wye

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/4 hours

Start: Parking around the village green at Boughton Lees

Comment: A pleasant and varied walk back to Wye with good views and a church to visit at Boughton Aluph. The A28 crossing requires special care and a short section of narrow grass verge. Across the low-lying fields beyond a sharp kink left, along a field edge, is required before a turn back right. Don’t be tempted to try a short cut.

This walk was completed on Sunday, 20th. August 2023 by Colin & Rosemary Bridge with their good friends Stephen & Eng Scoffham with mutual enjoyment of the varied countryside and environment.

With the Flying Horse pub behind, turn left down the road to the bottom corner. Keep on  along the road for a short distance, leaving the green behind.

In a few paces turn left, up a side road on The Pilgrims Way and the North Downs Way for ¼ mile.

Eventually as the road begins to rise, pass a footpath off right then a byway on a vehicle driveway off left.

As the road begins to bear right, turn left, up into a path enclosed between fences; still on the NDW.

Emerge into a field and continue up the side. At the top turn right through bushes, and then immediately left, still in the NDW.

Pass the church at Boughton Aluph on your left (well worth a visit and often open), and reach a roadway. Cross to the (currently) broken stile opposite.

Over this go forward up a pasture to double wooden fieldgates. Keep straight on across a field with excellent views.

At the far side, just before the top corner, bear right into bushes and follow an enclosed path around to a road.

Cross this and keep forward, downhill, on a gravel track towards a farm.

Pass through the farm buildings. Beyond, go through a wooden swing gate by a metal fieldgate.

Immediately turn right, up the bank into a field corner (no waymark here). Go down the field edge with a hedge on your right.

In the bottom corner drop steeply down through bushes and a wooden swing gate, into the field below.

Keep on down the edge with a hedge on your right. Reach a busy main road. Cross with care  and turn left along a narrow verge for 10 metres. Reach a footpath off right and cross a stile in the hedge.

Enter a field and go straight across the centre.

Cross a footbridge in the hedge ahead and bear right across the corner of the next field to a footbridge.

Cross and turn left along the side of a ditch on your left.

At the bottom corner turn left (it feels away from the general direction of the walk, but it is correct) across the field to the hedge ahead. DO NOT CONTINUETHROUGH THE HEDGE but turn sharp right, back across the bottom of the field.

Reach a hedge. Go through and on across a field to a footbridge over a brook. Continue on a feint, overgrown path towards a railway.

Cross this with care (used by high speed trains) and then the river bridge beyond.

Now bear right, aiming for the conspicuous tower of Wye church. In the corner go through a metal fieldgate and cross a concrete farm bridge. Bear right up towards a barn.

Continue past the barn on a driveway looking for a metal fieldgate into the field on your right. Through this go straight across the field.

Pass through two wooden kissing gates at the far side and on, down a concrete drive. Follow it around to the left, by houses on the right, onto a road, with a green space ahead.

Turn immediately right down a road called Abbots Walk. At the bottom turn right again down Churchfield Way.

Where this meets a main road, turn right to immediately reach the Tickled Trout pub with the Great Stour River and railway station just beyond and the start of the section.
