New Romney to St. Mary-in-theMarsh

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: From the Cinque Ports Arms pub at the western end of the High Street in New Romney. There is a paid car park opposite.

Comment: Half the walk is on metalled surfaces but this includes a long stretch of the coastal defence seawall. The roads are quiet with interesting houses, so, all-in-all quite a nicely balanced route. The return is all across fields.

From the car park in New Romney, opposite the Cinque Ports Arms pub, cross the main road and go down Lions Road opposite. Follow the road around to a junction. Cross Victoria Street and turn left towards the impressive parish church.

On reaching it, turn right down Church Lane, past a memorial garden and the restored old school, occasionally open with a history collection.

Keep along the lane for ½ mile. Where housing ends the road continues, but narrower and twisty, past industrial units. At the very end, ignore a bridleway off right and go forward to cross a railway.

In 15 metres reach a rough gravel track. Turn left on this for some way. The track becomes a road, and ignoring side roads, go up to a T-junction by a railway bridge, with the main station of the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch beyond.

Turn right on the main road past shops and cafes. Ignore the first turning off left, Warren Road, but turn left on the next turning, Links Way.

Soon cross St. Nicholas Road and continue on Links Way. At the next junction turn right up to a crossroads. Here turn left to pass the end of Anne Roper Close.

Keep on, past a golf club and some former coastguard terraces to reach another crossroads. Turn left along Madeira Road.

Keep along this road with some very large and stylish period houses. Reach an impressive water tower of red brick dated 1890. Bear right up to the sea wall with the shingle beach beyond.

Turn left along the wall for a mile.

On approaching St. Marys Bay, pass the first two houses down on your left. Reach a footpath off left down a concrete slope. Go down to a grassy area. Ignore the footpath going straight ahead, instead turn right along the grassy strip, parallel to the sea wall and coast on your right.

On reaching a T-junction, turn left on a path down by new housing, to a main road. Turn right along the main road for a short distance.

Cross and turn left up a road signed to the Village Hall. Keep up this quiet road for nearly ½ mile, passing shops and the Bailiff’s Sergeant pub. Halfway up cross a narrow gauge railway by a station halt. Finally pass a playing field.

Where the road turns sharp left, bear right onto a footpath alongside a stream.

Soon cross a stile by a metal fieldgate, and continue up the pasture beyond on a grassy track. Keep northwards on the track up several pastures to reach an old pond with a large Sallow tree completely covering it.

Here turn left, still on a feint grassy track. The spire of the church at St. Mary-in-the-Marsh can be glimpsed as a reference point to aim for.

Follow the grassy track to a gated footbridge, and continue across an open field towards a barn.

Reach a nd cross a footbridge into a further pasture and go jup with a fence on your left.

Cross another gated footbridge, out to a road. Cross to a further footbridge. Bear left across the field ahead.

In the far corner cross into the next field and head more directly towards the village. Reach the next corner and cross a final footbridge and a final field.

At the far side go through a gap in the fence to a lawned area at the side of The Star pub. Go down to a road and turn right to the pub with the ancient church across the way, and the end of the section.

Section 27  Return

St. Mary-in-the-Marsh to New Romney

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 7 miles/4 hours

Start: The Star Inn, fairly relaxed parking here.

Comment: Visit the church at the start. Fields and footbridges again and paths that seem little used. New housing on approaching New Romney needs a little negotiating.

Leave the pub and turn left, then off the road, back into the grassy, lawned are at the side of the pub.

This time bear diagonally right, across the grass. Continue across the field beyond and out to a road. Bear left a few paces, to a metal kissing gate the other side.

Enter a pasture and turn quite sharply left over to a stile.

Continue across the next field. Then cross a footbridge over the New Sewer. Now turn sharp right alongside the sewer.

Where the sewer veers right, bear left across the open field towards distant New Romney.

At the top end of the field cross a massive footbridge. Turn right alongside a drainage ditch. Where this swings right, turn left, up the edge of a field with another ditch on your right.

At the next junction, ignore a footpath off left and, using a farm bridge, go straight ahead, along the field edge with yet another stream on the right.

Wiggle all the way around the field edge, ignoring a concrete footbridge off right, to reach a corner of new housing.

Here leave the field and bear sharp right on a grassy path between fences, stick by the fence on your right to wind around to a road.

Turn left on the road but use a narrow parallel footpath if you can.

In a short distance turn right along Pearmain Way (new housing has obliterated the former footpath here).

In a short distance turn left on a tarmac path opposite Ruben Crescent. Follow the path as it zigzags through new housing (ignore a turning off right). Eventually exit onto a road at the point of the original path.

Turn right along the road for a good way, finally passing a playing field, to reach a T-junction.

Turn left, then immediately right into Sussex Road. At the junction at the end turn left and soon return to the car park and the Cinque Port Arms pub in New Romney and the start of the section.
