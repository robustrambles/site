Snargate to Ivychurch

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/5 hours

Start: The Red Lion pub in Snargate. There is very limited on road parking by the church. At the pub if a patron.

Comment: A walk with more road walking than intended as many paths are missing or unwalkable in this area. Luckily the country lanes are quiet and narrow and generally pleasant to walk.

With the Red Lion pub behind, cross to the side road opposite. At the entrance to the church (well worth a visit) turn right down a bridlepath for ½ mile.

Exit onto a road and turn right for ¼ mile. Go around a bend past cottages on the right, to reach a metal fieldgate on your left. Ignore the footpath off right. Instead turn left, through the fieldgate and go straight across the field.

When Brenzett Church comes into view on the right, meet a cross path. Turn right on this to go across to the church. Cross a broken stile and climb the bank. Go to the right, around the end of the church, to the porch (well worth a visit) and turn right down the entrance way, to a drive out to a road.

Turn right on the road and shortly reach the end of a side road (Church Lane) on the right. Opposite a path starts in the field corner. There is no obvious access although the path can be seen crossing the field. Find a way in !

Follow the path diagonally right across the field. In mid-field it bears slightly left to reach the far opposite corner. Cross a concrete bridge and continue on up the field to fieldgates leading to a very busy road.

Cross the road with patience and enormous care to further fieldgates the other side. Through these bear diagonally left across a field aiming just left of the Museum building ahead (annoyingly the path has to dogleg around the corner of the perimeter fence). Exit onto a road.

Turn right for some way passing the museum and old RAF houses on the right. Near the end, turn left down a side road. Emerge at the end onto the side of a very busy main road with a petrol station opposite.

Cross the road with great care and turn left. Along the verge. Just before a house, turn right down the side. Our path goes diagonally left across the field on the left. A fence of wire netting blocks the access. Cross in any way you can.

Follow the path diagonally left across the field to a footbridge leading out to Tickner’s Lane. Turn right.

In 50 metres, turn left between bushes on a tractor entrance to a field. Go straight across to a footbridge at the far side onto Tillery Lane.

Cross footbridge to the footpath opposite and go up the field edge. In mid-field meet a cross track. Turn diagonally left over to the hedgerow on your left ahead.

Turn right, with the hedge on your left, to a metal fieldgate at the top and exit onto Eighteen Acre Lane, by a reservoir.

Turn left up the lane to a main road. Cross to Wenham’s Lane and keep forward for a mile.

The lane bears left at the end. Pass an agricultural depot. Immediately turn right onto the brick road of a new housing development. Near the end look for a grassy path off left between fences.

Turn left up here and soon reach a playing field. Go down the side to a road and cross to The Bell pub in Ivychurch and the end of the section.

Ivychurch to Snargate

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/5 hours

Start: The Bell in Ivychurch, there is a small car park by the park, opposite.

Comment: Finally a walk through countryside ! Many fields and footbridges to cross. Exercise care and patience when crossing the A2070 road. Traffic travels at excessive speed and the volume is often heavy.

With The Bell behind, turn right a few paces, then left down Ivychurch Road, past the playing field and village hall. Continue for ¼ mile.

Look for a footpath off right, through roadside trees to a footbridge leading to a huge field. The footbridge points the way forward, look out for a footbridge at the far side as you go.

This second footbridge leads to another large field. Bear slightly left between two telegraph poles. Emerge onto a road at a metal fingerpost.

Cross road and continue over another field, again to exit onto a road. This time cross and bear sharp left across the field corner to another road.

Now turn right on the road, up to a dead end at the very busy Ashford road.

Bear left to double metal fieldgates and climb up to the main road. Cross with great care as the traffic moves at high speed, to another set of double metal fieldgates at the far side. Go through and bear right across to another dead end road. Turn left on this.

Soon reach a T-junction. Turn right a few paces then left down into a large field. Bear slightly diagonally left to the top left corner (the footbridge at the top on the line of the path is impassable).

Cross the tractor bridge in the top corner and again go diagonally left to the top left corner by trees in this next field.

Once again there is a footbridge in the corner. Cross and turn sharp right, through the trees to a metal equestrian gate into a pasture.

Go up the field edge by the stream on the right to the top corner and exit through a metal fieldgate onto a road.

Turn right for 30 metres, then left over a footbridge. Bear diagonally right across a field to another footbridge in a long series of bridges.

Over this bridge two paths diverge. Take the lefthand one across to a visible footbridge.

Over this continue straight over a field to the next footbridge. With Snargate church now in view, bear left up the pasture to the top left corner.

Reach and cross another footbridge and head diagonally right across a smaller pasture to exit on the road by the church (there is no obvious way out of the field but the fence can be crossed or a gate climbed).

Turn left to a T-junction opposite the Red Lion pub in Snargate and the start of the section.
