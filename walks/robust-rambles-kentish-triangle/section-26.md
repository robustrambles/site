Ivychurch to New Romney

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/5 hours

Start: Some parking at the village hall opposite the pub in Ivychurch.

Comment: A walk across many very large fields, formerly pastures. Some road walking on quiet country lanes. No shelter from sun or rain so carry appropriate gear.

With The Bell pub behind, turn sharp left down the side of the pub to enter the churchyard. Go down past the church (well worth a visit) on your left, to the bottom corner. Go through a metal kissing gate and cross a footbridge into an enclosed path. Soon exit onto a field.

Aim slightly right across the field to what looks like a lone bush with a tall tree behind.

On reaching the bush it becomes evident that it is in fact the start of a hedge. Go on, along this hedge with it on your right.

Reach a corner of the ditch on your right. Here bear left across the field towards a lone tree, aiming between two pylons beyond. Pass the tree to reach a footbridge and continue over the field ahead to a further footbridge.

Cross and continue to reach a sunken footbridge un der power lines. Cross this and bear right along the field edge with a ditch on your right. Where the ditch swings right, keep straight on.

Reach and cross an old footbridge and bear slightly left to reach a narrow footbridge by a hedge. Go up the field to a final footbridge onto a road.

Turn right for ½ mile. On finally reaching a T-junction, go straight across to a footbridge in the hedge. Go straight across the field aiming left of New Romney church tower.

Reach and cross a long footbridge and go forward across a large field.

Go through a metal swing gate at the far side and up a grassy track. Cross a gated footbridge at the top.

Turn sharply left along a field edge with a ditch on your left. Where the ditch swings slightly left, turn right across the field towards white houses.

Reach the far side and exit with difficulty onto a road. Cross over to a path alongside a stream. Soon reach the Stone Bridge on your left.

Cross into a paddock and go down the left side to reach and cross a stile. Continue over two more. Exit onto a road.

Go straight forward down the road to a junction and on in the same direction down West Street to reach the Cinque Ports Arms in New Romney and the end of the section.

New Romney to Ivychurch

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 8 miles/5 hours

Start: Car Park opposite the Cinque Port Arms pub in New Romney.

Comment: A walk with some difficulties. A broken stile near the start and obscure paths obviously little used. Keep the map and a compass or electronic mapping to keep on the right track. There is a race track to negotiate on the approach to Ivychurch. Keep up the righthand side.

With the Cinque Port Arms pub behind, go back up West Street opposite. Turn first left into St. John’s Road.

At the end find a safe place to cross to the footpath opposite. Cross a broken stile with difficulty and go along the field edge with a hedge on your right.

Reach a corner. Ignoring footpath off left, turn right then left along the top field edge. Half way along reach a post off right; across the field is a farm. (IF YOU DROP DOWN TO CROSS A STREAM YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR) From the post, bear diagonally right across the field – aiming just right of the farm - to reach a road junction at Hammond’s Corner.

The roads are busy at this junction, so bear left to cross the side road (B2075 to Lydd) and go forward a few paces along the main road before turning right to cross this to a house called High Haven concealed in trees.

There is a Public Footpath finger post in the foliage on the left, so go through the gates into the garden. Go straight up, past the house on your right, to the very top corner of the garden.

Find a gated footbridge hidden in the trees leading to a field. There is no evidence of a path from here.

Follow the righthand edge of the field as it curves left then right. Where the hedge and ditch really swing away right, look left across the field to find a footbridge.

Cross the field to this bridge. From the end of the bridge scan around to locate two further footbridges. Bear left over to the bridge on your left.

Cross this and bear diagonally right over the field towards power lines.

Reach a metal fieldgate and cross a brick bridge to the track along the Walkingham Sewer.

Turn left all the way to Old Romney. Emerge on a road by the entrance to the church (visit highly recommended).

Turn right along the road. In 70 metres reach a metal fieldgate on your left. Turn left into the field corner. Now bear right to follow the field edge in a circle around to the right.

At the far side of the circuit, reach another double fieldgate. Turn left, away from the gates, up the side of the field with a ditch on your right.

Follow the path as it zigzags right then left, still by the ditch, to a footbridge. Cross to the field corner on the right. Bear diagonally left across the side of the field (or follow the field edge around) to a footbridge at the far side.

Cross the bridge and go slightly diagonally right up the field to a further bridge.

Cross field ahead to yet another bridge, then diagonally right across another huge field towards the church tower in Ivychurch.

Cross a footbridge into the grounds of a racetrack. Go ahead up the righthand side. At the top continue into an open grassy area.

In the very top corner of this area go through a narrow gap to a stile. Turn diagonally left across the field to a road.

Turn left on the road to reach The Bell in Ivychurch and the start of the section.
