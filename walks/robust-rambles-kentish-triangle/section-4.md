Section 4 Out

Stalisfield Green to Warren Street

OS Map: Explorer 149 Sittingbourne & Faversham

Total Circular Distance: 5 miles (3 hours)

Start: The Plough Inn at Stalisfield Green, pub parking for patrons.

Comment: Quiet and isolated country with some very neglected paths and tough going. Be prepared to go around field edges if paths not reinstated through crops or woods. Several stiles but most in very poor condition.

Check the Harrow Inn Hotel at Warren Street for opening times beforehand.

With The Plough Inn on your right and the village hall on the left, go forward a few paces, then turn right across the grass to enter an enclosed footpath passing down the side of a house on the left.

Continue up and into a field. Keep on with a hedge on your left. Halfway up the field bear left through a gap and immediately right to continue up the hedge – now on  your right. Emerge past a metal fieldgate onto a road at the top.

Turn right on the road a few paces. Where the road bears left, go straight on up a bridleway to Hall’s Place. Follow the track round past the house to reach a road. Cross to stile in the hedge opposite (this was very overgrown but there is a tractor entrance just down the hill).

From the stile the path should cross the field to the bottom right corner. If crops prevent this, go down the lefthand edge with a wire fence on your left. Bear right at a corner and continue along to a stile at the lowest point of the field.

Cross this stile into trees and go steeply down an old set of steps to a wide sunken track. Take care as the steps are overgrown. Cross the track and continue down to a stile into a rising pasture. Go straight up the field aiming for a white house at the top called The Old Rectory.

Exit over a broken stile by a metal fieldgate onto a road in front of the rectory(note impressive Otterden Place over on the right). Turn left along the road. Immediately past the vehicle entrance to The Old Rectory, turn right up a path enclosed between a wire fence and a tall hedge.

Cross a good stile into a field and continue with a hedge on your left to a wood at the far side. Cross another broken stile by a metal fieldgate and go down into the wood.

At the far side leave the wood by a metal kissing gate and head uphill towards a house. On nearing the top of the rise, bear left to a stile in the fence on your left. Cross over to the top of a group of trees ahead.

Go along past the trees to a stile. Cross and drop down to a farm track. Turn right up this passing Hurst Farm at the top to reach a road. Turn left on the road for 50 metres, then right over a stile.

Cross a field to a wood. A path enters the wood and goes up a track. In a short distance a footpath should turn off left on a feint path which parallels the edge of the wood on the left and eventually bears left to the edge and exits over a stile into a field. It then turns right along the edge to a road. BUT THERE ARE NO WAYMARKS IN THE WOOD, THE PATH IS DIFFICULT TO FIND AND HEAVILY OVERGROWN WITH GROUND LEVEL BRAMBLES. Instead of entering the wood it is possible to simply turn left along the field edge with the wood on your right and follow along all the way to a road.

Cross the road to a squeeze stile in the hedge opposite, once again heavily overgrown. Enter a field and go straight across aiming just left of farm storage silos on the far side. Emerge onto a road at Bunker’s Hill.

Turn right on the road. Where the road soon bears left, cross a metal fieldgate into a field. Bear slightly right across the high part of the field to a stile by a substantial tree at the far side.

Cross and go up the side of a wood to soon reach a corner. Here turn sharply left, back across the field to the bottom left corner. Find a stile and cross to drop down a bank to a bridleway. Turn left along to a road.

Turn right uphill. In a short distance, go left through the hedge and over a stile into a field. Go along by the fence and treeline on your right to a stile into the next field. Cross and turn left diagonally across the field. Aim just left of a circle of trees midfield to buildings at the very top.

Exit onto a road and turn right. Eventually reach a T-junction. Turn right down to a second junction with ‘The Harrow’ country hotel immediately ahead. This is Warren Street and the end of the section.

Section 4 Return

Warren Street to Stalisfield Green

OS Map: Explorer 149 Sittingbourne & Faversham

Total Circular Distance: 5 miles (3 hours)

Start: The Harrow Inn at Warren Street. Parking nearby.

Comment:

With The Harrow country hotel on your right, go forward down the side road ahead called Waterditch Lane. Ignore a road off right and in a few paces turn left off the road on a path by large tree trunks.

Cross a stile into a field. Go across the centre of the field to a gap in the far hedge. Here cross a stile, unpleasantly narrow with barbed wire attached, and cross the next field in the same direction.

Enter the next field and turn diagonally right across the centre. On reaching the corner of the field on your right, turn sharp right through the fence and then diagonally across the centre of the field towards a wood.

Enter and cross the corner of the wood to a stile into a field. Bear diagonally left across to a distant house. At the far side reach a road. Immediately turn left over the remains of a stile and footbridge to reach a wooden kissing gate.

Bear diagonally right across horse paddocks. The route is marked by wooden pedestrian gates in the fences. The final one, just left of a house, opens into the garden. Pass the house on your right to exit onto a road (the area of the house is rather untidy and littered with plastic).

Turn left up the road for ¼ mile.

Where the road dips down at a left bend, turn right on a stony bridleway. At a Y-fork, bear left, and keep uphill, ignoring side tracks.

Emerge onto a road. Cross to a metal gate. Through this bear sharp left, across the pasture to a fence and second metal gate. Enter and turn sharp right, along the field edge with the fence on your right.

Keep on down a second field to a tall stile and cross a neck of trees to a rising field. Bear slightly right up to a corner of trees and continue along the edge.

On reaching a rusty metal fieldgate on the left, go through and turn right on a vehicle drive to a road. Turn left to soon return to The Plough Inn at Stalisfield Green and the start of the section.
