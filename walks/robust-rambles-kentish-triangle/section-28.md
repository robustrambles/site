Section 28  Out

St Mary in the Marsh to Newchurch

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 6 miles/4 hours

Start: From The Star pub in St Mary in the Marsh, limited parking apart from the pub.

Comment: The pub here is open seven days a week, as is the church, so a good place to start and finish a walk. Not a very long walk and some over pasture which is a receding pleasure on the Marsh. A small amount of quiet road walking. Again, very open country so no shelter from the weather. Some old and difficult stiles. Entrances to paths are often overgrown so secateurs recommended. Unfortunately, Newchurch has no facilities, either shop or pub. Take a picnic and sit by the Village Hall or the church.

With The Star pub behind walk up the road opposite, passing the church on your right, for ¼ mile. Ignore the footpath off right by the farm and continue up the road.

Also ignore the first footpath off left, by a hedge, and continue up the road.

On a sharp right bend, cross a stile into a pasture and bear quite sharply right (sharper than the fingerpost suggests, that is not up to the very top most corner).

So, turn right, and cross to a bush with a stile behind it.

Over this bear diagonally right across field to a footbridge. Over the bridge turn right along the field edge, then soon slightly left, diagonally across a large field, generally towards a distant white house.

At the top of the field cross a ditch and turn right along the edge with the ditch on your right.

Eventually reach a footbridge into a field and turn diagonally left across it.

In the hedge at the top cross a footbridge into a pasture and bear diagonally left towards a distant farm.

Cross a stile in a wooden fence midfield and keep on up to the top corner. Exit as best you can onto a road and go forward ¼ mile, past Norwood Farm, to a road junction.

Look for a footpath in the Y-fork, over a footbridge into a caravan park. Emerge by the reception and go diagonally across the centre of the park to the top opposite corner.

Just left of the corner is a water tap. To its right are two concrete blocks making do for a stile over the wire fence. Cross this and bear diagonally right across the pasture to a footbridge in the hedge.

Cross this then straight up the field to a sewer. Bear left then right alongside the sewer, down the edge of a field to a footbridge out to a road.

Turn right on the road for some way, past a farm on the right, then over Norwood Lane and on past derelict farm buildings to a metal kissing gate and footbridge on the right.

Cross into a pasture. Two paths lead off from here. Take the righthand one, diagonally across the centre of the pasture to a large barn at the far side.

In midfield go through a metal fieldgate at the end of a very deep ditch and continue across to a homemade metal gate, just left of the barn, into a paddock of old farm machinery.

Go up to a stile by a metal fieldgate. Turn left and continue through further gates out to a road. Opposite is the Village Hall and end of the section in Newchurch.

Section 28  Return

Newchurch to St Mary in the Marsh

OS Map: Explorer 125 Romney Marsh

Total Circular Distance: 6 miles/4 hours

Start: From The Village Hall in Newchurch, very limited on road parking.

Comment: A small amount of quiet road walking. Again very open country so no shelter from the weather. Some old and difficult stiles. Two old and decaying footbridges, so special care needed. Entrances to paths often overgrown so secateurs recommended.

With the Village Hall on your left, walk along the road, out of the village. In 150 metres, pass Manor House on your right.

Immediately past the house, turn right, over a footbridge and stile in the hedge, into a pasture.

Walk directly away from the road, across the centre of the field. Pick up a hedge and ditch on your left near the top.

In the top corner reach, and cross, a footbridge. From this bear diagonally left across a field.

Cross a ditch at the far side and turn immediately right alongside a ditch on your right.

At a corner, turn left with the ditch.

The ditch soon turns right. Go up into a corner of a field and bear diagonally right across the centre of a huge field (aim to the left of St Mary in the Marsh church tower in the distance).

At the top of the field, cross a footbridge (currently the planks at each end are rotten so take care).

Now bear right, across a field aiming directly for the church tower.

Reach a footbridge and stile in the top hedge (both are dangerously rotten and covered in moss).

Over these, turn immediately left along the field edge to a metal fieldgate out to a road. There is no waymarking here. The path should actually turn right along the field edge with the hedge on your left and exit onto the road opposite the two houses soon reached.

Turn right along the road, soon reaching the entrance drive to Pickney Bush Farm.

Bear left over to a stile and continue up a paddock, past a solitary gate midfield to a wooden gate at the top.

Bear left across the next large pasture to a stile at the far side with the church tower directly ahead.

Go straight across the next field, slightly right of the church tower.

At the top of the field, cross into the next field and bear left across the centre with the village ahead.

Exit onto a road by a farm. Turn left, a short way, to reach the church and pub in the centre of St Mary in the Marsh.
