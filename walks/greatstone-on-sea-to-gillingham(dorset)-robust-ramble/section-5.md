GREATSTONE TO GILLINGHAM ROBUST RAMBLE

Section 5  Out

Iden to Peasmarsh

Map: OS Explorer 125 Romney Marsh, Rye & Winchelsea

Distance/Time: 3 miles/2 hours

Start: The Bell Iden, pub or on-road parking.

Comment: A shorter section, off the marshes and into farmland, even some orchards. Some road walking at the start along quiet lanes. The Horse & Cart pub, by School Lane, in Peasmarsh is currently closed. The Cock Inn is further up the Main Road.

With The Bell pub on your left walk forward down the road to soon reach a Y-fork. Bear left along Church Lane passing the village shop on your left. Continue along this road for ¼ mile passing the church up on the left. Eventually pass a pond on your left and continue, ignoring a permissive path off right (with green arrow waymarks).

Bear left on the road up and around a bend to a row of Holly trees. Here cross a stile on your right into an orchard. Bear diagonally left up a row between the trees.

Reach a corner of orchards. Continue in the same direction passing a pylon on your right. Continue to a road. Turn left along the road for 200 metres up to a T-junction. Turn right a few paces, then right again through a gap into a large field.

Go down the field bearing slightly left. Keep roughly parallel with the hedge over on your right, always at least 50 metres, more at the start.

At the bottom corner of the field bear over to meet the hedge at a tall wooden power line pole. Just beyond is a gateway. Do not go through but go on down hill this time along the edge of an orchard with a wire fence and hedge on your right.

At the very bottom of the hill bear slightly right a few paces through a gap and on over a stream. Go on up the side of another orchard with hedge and woods on your left.

In the top corner there is an open area and junction of paths. Bear right to a metal fieldgate and continue forward on a bridleway with a ditch and treeline on your right. At the end reach a rough gravel farm track.

Gross this and go straight down to footbridge by a wood in the valley below. Cross bridge and turn left along the edge of the wood. Where the wood ends, continue up towards a low brick cattle shed at the farm ahead. Reach a kissing gate and turn left on a farm road.

Soon reach the large open concrete area of the main farmyard. Turn right up it passing large barns on your left and a pond on your right to reach the entrance to the farmhouse. Here turn left through a gap between buildings to a stile. Cross an enclosure to a second stile leading into woods.

Follow a clear track uphill. At the highest point is a Y-fork. Bear right here ignoring side tracks. Keep on to the end of the wood. The path becomes a private road and emerges onto a main road.

Turn left down through the village to reach the, currently closed, Horse and Cart and the end of the section.

Section 5  Return

Peasmarsh to Iden

Map: OS Explorer 125 Romney Marsh, Rye & Winchelsea

Distance/Time: 3 miles/2 hours

Start: The, currently closed, Horse & Cart in Peasmarsh by School Lane. The Cock Inn is further up the road with car park plus on-road parking.

Comment: Easy return with a long straight stretch by woods to start with then twists and turns through undulating countryside. There are several stiles.  

With the former Horse and Cart pub on your left walk up the main road looking for the first turning on your right called The Maltings. Turn along this to reach a small development of rural business units. Just right is a playing field.

Enter the field through a pedestrian gate and go on down past a pavilion to a gate by a pole in the fence beyond. Exit onto a concrete track. Turn right along it. Keep on after the concrete ends for a mile. It’s an easy walking byway.

Eventually emerge onto a road. Turn left for 20 metres, then right over a tall stile. Follow the fence on your right for 100 metres, then cross a stile on the right to go diagonally left across a field to another stile.

Soon cross a third stile into a corner of a field. Go ahead down the side of the field with a fence on your right. Near the bottom of the field, ignore a footpath off right and keep forward past buildings on your right. At the bottom corner of the field ignore another stile off right, and stay on the field edge, bearing left around the bottom corner and on up the side with woods and a fence on your right, following a line of power line poles (this route round the field edge is easy to follow and obviously walked although not quite the same as the footpaths on the OS map).

Halfway up the hill, turn right over a footbridge and stile. Again, the route currently used, turns left along the field edge, bearing right at the corner to continue uphill, passing a pond in trees on your left.

Follow the field edge left across the top of the pond and on with a fence and horse paddocks on your left to a corner. Reach and cross a stile and continue down a field edge, passing Iden Court on your left.

In the bottom corner, go through a gate and over what appears to have been a mill race and enter a recreation ground. Head across to the church at the far side.

Cross the entrance drive and enter the churchyard. Continue, passing the church on your left to a gate at the far side. Exit, bearing left down to a road. Turn right, back past the village shop to reach The Bell at Iden and the start of the section.
