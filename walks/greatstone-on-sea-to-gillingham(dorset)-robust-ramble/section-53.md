Broad Chalke to Fovant

Map: OS Explorer 130 Salisbury

Distance: 3 miles/ 2 hours

Start: There is a car park by Broad Chalke church.

Comment: This walk is a dramatic change to the river valley sections before it. The route goes high on the downs with panoramic views but inevitable climbs. The drove roads and byways may go back to prehistoric times and are long, no-nonsense routes in long straight lines. Most are today’s farm tracks and surfaced for heavy machinery. Byways are surprisingly random in condition and can disappear into feint, overgrown footpaths without warning. The long bridleway out of Broad Chalke leads to a reservoir and has been surfaced as a road so a long climb on a hard surface. Fovant is a disappointing place. The pub was not open. There is a shop for provisions but amazingly there is nowhere nearby to sit for refreshment in the village.

With the Queens Head behind, turn right and follow the road around a sharp righthand bend. Keep on forward ignoring all side roads. Where the main road swings left, go forward up the road to Chalk Pyt Farm.

Go between farm buildings and then straight on, steeply up a bridleway at the far side.

The bridleway is laid as a road for access to a reservoir at the top, so easy going uphill but not exciting walking.

After ½ mile the roadway levels off for another ½ mile.

At a slight bend right and left just above halfway, ignore a permissive path off left and keep on up the road.

At the top, pass a reservoir on the right and go through a heavy duty metal barrier to a T-junction with a wide byway.

Turn left along this on Compton Down for nearly a mile.

Eventually reach a metal fieldgate on your right and turn into a rough field. Go straight ahead up a grassy path, then straight ahead into a field.

At the far side of the field, begin a long drop down, bearing slightly left to the farm in the valley below.

The path, once established, is easy to follow although, essentially, it’s only a narrow chalky sheep track, so take care.

On regaining grass at the bottom, go forward a few metres then turn right to a rusty metal fieldgate. Go through to a grassy farm track heading for a white stone house ahead and farm buildings beyond.

Pass the house on your left and immediately turn left on a broad access drive passing a fine row of chestnut trees.

Stay on this drive for some way. Reach a sharp right bend (notice an equestrian gate by a metal fieldgate on the left used on the return) and follow the drive round and on between houses.

At a Y-fork bear right up the old road through the village of Fovant. At the top end cross the main road with care to The Greater Good Inn and the village shop just beyond and the end of the section.

Section 53  Return

Fovant to Broad Chalke

Map: OS Explorer 130 Salisbury

Distance: 3 miles/ 2 hours

Start: There is a car park at the pub but little opportunity for on-street parking.

Comment: The return has a very stiff climb and some surprisingly narrow overgrown paths as all are byways or bridleways. Once again some long straight sections. A final pleasant stroll along the river in to Broad Chalke.

From the Greater Good Inn cross the main road and go down Brook Street opposite as on the outward route. At the end of the old village street, go forward to a rough drive between houses.

At a sharp left bend go right through an equestrian gate by a metal fieldgate, and up the field with the fence on your left.

At the top corner go through a further equestrian gate and straight on across the centre of a field.

At the far side continue briefly up by the hedge on your left to a corner. Bear left through the hedge into a narrow path. Reach another equestrian gate and continue up.

Emerge onto a broad grassy track and continue steeply up.

At the top bear left onto a track coming up from the right.

Keep quite steeply up this for a good distance, it becomes narrow and overgrown.

Eventually reach a metal fieldgate at the top and emerge onto a broad byway.

Cross straight over to a narrow grassy bridleway. Cross a fallen tree and soon reach a metal fieldgate with equestrian gate alongside. Go through into a field corner.

Go ahead, down the side with a hedge on your right for ½ mile. The path becomes a gravel farm track then concrete.

Reach a crossing of ways by a barn. Turn left, off the concrete track and across asphalt, past huts to the start of two grassy tracks. Take the righthand one with a fence on your left.

Reach a Y-fork by double metal fieldgates on the left. Keep right on the higher path swinging off right along the edge of a field.

Watch out for the track splitting with a narrower green path running along on the left. Join this (the higher track swings off right across the open field). The narrower path goes downhill as an enclosed path between overarching bushes for nearly a mile.

Finally emerge on a main road at the bottom. Cross and bear right down an asphalt track towards a house. Just before, turn left on a gravel path and soon reach a wooden kissing gate. Continue down through trees.

Cross a long stretch of grass, finally bearing left up to a metal kissing gate at the rear of a house. Go forward on an enclosed path.

Continue on a wellmade path at the foot of gardens and by allotments. The path becomes a vehicle track before emerging on a main road in Broad Chalke. Turn right then left at the bend ahead to regain the Queens Head and the start of the section.
